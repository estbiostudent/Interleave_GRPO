We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\n\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.\n\nThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\n\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\n\nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\n\nThis much we pledge--and more.\n\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\n\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\n\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich."

And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.\n\nIt will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\nThe attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.\n\nYesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya.\n\nLast night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.\n\nLast night, Japanese forces attacked Guam.\n\nLast night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.\n\nLast night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island.\n\nAnd this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island.\n\nJapan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.\n\nAs Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense. But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.\n\nNo matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.\n\nI believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.\n\nHostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.\n\nWith confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God.\n\nI ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire."

      "text": "No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\n\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\n\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourself to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\n\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.\n\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace -- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!"

      "text": "Fellow-Countrymen:\n\nAt this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\n\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war—seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\n\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. \"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"\n\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."

I constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.\n\nI rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety, and am persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that, in the present circumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination to retire.\n\nThe impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I will only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and administration of the government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n\nIn looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services, let it always be remembered to your praise, and as an instructive example in our annals, that under circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead, amidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it."

Today is a day for mourning and remembering.\n\nNancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful events like this happen. They are part of the process of exploration and discovery. They are part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you."

I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'\nAnd I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries\nThen say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:\nOr if thou think'st I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true love's passion: therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night has so discovered.\n\nROMEO\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I swear\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--\n\nJULIET\nO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n\nROMEO\nWhat shall I swear by?\n\nJULIET\nDo not swear at all;\nOr, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\n\nROMEO\nIf my heart's dear love--\n\nJULIET\nWell, do not swear: although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night:\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! as sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\n\nROMEO\nO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\n\nJULIET\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\n\nROMEO\nThe exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\n\nJULIET\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it:\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\n\nROMEO\nWouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?\n\nJULIET\nBut to be frank, and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have:\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\n\n[Nurse calls within]\n\nI hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again.\n\n[Exit, above]\n\nROMEO\nO blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\nToo flattering-sweet to be substantial.\n\n[Re-enter JULIET, above]\n\nJULIET\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\n\nNURSE\n[Within] Madam!\n\nJULIET\nI come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,\nI do beseech thee--\n\nNURSE\n[Within] Madam!\n\nJULIET\nBy and by, I come:--\nTo cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:\nTo-morrow will I send.\n\nROMEO\nSo thrive my soul--\n\nJULIET\nA thousand times good night!\n\n[Exit, above]\n\nROMEO\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\nLove goes toward love, as schoolboys from\n their books,\nBut love from love, toward school with heavy looks.\n\n[Retiring]\n\n[Re-enter JULIET, above]\n\nJULIET\nHist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\n\nROMEO\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name:\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears!\n\nJULIET\nRomeo!\n\nROMEO\nMy dear?\n\nJULIET\nAt what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\n\nROMEO\nAt the hour of nine.\n\nJULIET\nI will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\n\nROMEO\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\n\nJULIET\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRemembering how I love thy company.\n\nROMEO\nAnd I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\n\nJULIET\n'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:\nAnd yet no further than a wanton's bird;\nWho lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\n\nROMEO\nI would I were thy bird.\n\nJULIET\nSweet, so would I:\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! parting is such\nsweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n\n[Exit above]\n\nROMEO\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\nHence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\nHis help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.\n\n[Exit]"

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

      "text": "Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.\n\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\n\nThere are two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.\n\nIt could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.\n\nThe second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties."

In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.\n\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.\n\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\n\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence."

Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\n\n“How so? How can it affect them?”\n\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\n\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\n\n“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.”\n\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”\n\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\n\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\n\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”\n\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\n\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.”\n\n“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\n\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”\n\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”\n\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”\n\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.”\n\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\n\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\n\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.”\n\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.”\n\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news."

      "text": "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever."

The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.\n\nThree days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky—Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world—woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o’clock in the morning, not in his wife’s bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.\n\n“Yes, yes, how was it now?” he thought, going over his dream. “Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang, Il mio tesoro—not Il mio tesoro though, but something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they were women, too,” he remembered.\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile. “Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that was delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even expressing it in one’s thoughts awake.” And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife, and sat down upon the floor.\n\n“That’s right, that’s right,” he thought; “but how was it? why did she seem so foreign?” He jumped up, sat on the sofa, and opened his eyes wide.\n\n“Yes, she saw that it wasn’t the thing, but she didn’t say so, she understood, she felt sorry for me. Yes, she’s right, she’s right....”\n\nHe remembered his dream again.\n\n“Yes, there were decanters, but they were women; that was it, that was it!”\n\nHe smiled, and lying down again on the sofa, he put his arms under his head and sank into thought.\n\n“How delightful it was,” he thought. “Yes, if only one could express it, if only one could put it into words....”"

      "text": "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\n\n“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”\n\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."

      "text": "Somewhere in la Mancha, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, a gentleman lived not long ago, one of those who has a lance and ancient shield on a shelf and keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing. An occasional stew, beef more often than lamb, hash most nights, eggs and abstinence on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, sometimes squab as a treat on Sundays—these consumed three-fourths of his income. The rest went for a light woolen tunic and velvet breeches and a pair of velvet slippers for feast days, and weekdays he made a fine appearance in his homespun best. Living with him were a housekeeper in her forties, a niece not yet twenty and a lad of the field and market who saddled the nag and wielded a pruning knife.\n\nOur gentleman was approximately fifty years old; of sturdy constitution, thin-bodied, lean-faced, a great early riser and a lover of hunting. Some claim that his family name was Quijada or Quesada—there is a certain variance among the authors who address this matter—although reliable conjecture seems to indicate that his name was Quijana. But this does not matter very much to our story; in its telling there is absolutely no deviation from the truth.\n\nAnd so, let us remember that this aforementioned gentleman spent his times of leisure—which meant most of the year—reading books of chivalry with so much pleasure and devotion that he forgot almost completely about the hunt and even about the administration of his estate; and in his rash curiosity and folly he sold many acres of arable land to buy books of knighthood he could read, and he brought as many of them as he could into his house; and he thought none was as fine as those composed by the worthy Feliciano de Silva, because the clarity of his prose and complexity of his language seemed to him like pearls, and especially when he came to read the declarations of love and the challenges they so often contain, where in many places he found these words written: the reason for the unreason to my reason subjected, in such a manner my reason enslaves me, that with reason I complain of your comeliness. And also when he read: the high Heavens that with your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars and make you deserving of the deserts that your greatness deserves.\n\nWith these reasons he would lose his own, and he would be absorbed by them to such an extent that he spent sleepless nights reading from beginning to end, and his days from first light to twilight; and so from reading so little and sleeping so little, his brain dried up and he came to lose his wits. His fantasy filled with everything he had read in the books, enchantments as well as combats, battles, challenges, wounds, sweet talk, loves, torments, and other impossible foolishness, and those things so occupied his mind that the whole fabric of fancy and odd invention he read about was true, that for him no history in the world was truer. He would say that El Cid Ruy Díaz was a very good knight but could not compare to the Knight of the Flaming Sword, who with a single backstroke had cut in two two fierce and colossal giants. He was happier with Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he had slain Roland the Enchanted by availing himself of Hercules' cleverness when he strangled Antaeus, son of Earth, in his arms. He said many good things about the giant Morgante because, although he belonged to the gigantic, arrogant race that all giants are, he alone was affable and well-bred. But he liked none better than Reinaldos de Montalbán, above all when he saw him emerge from his castle and rob everyone he met, and when he crossed the sea and stole the idol of Mohammed made all of gold, as his history relates. To have a bout of kicking with the traitor Galalon would have been worth all the gold in the world to him.\n\nIn short, our gentleman became so caught up in reading that he spent his nights reading from dusk till dawn and his days reading from sunrise to sunset, and so with too little sleep and too much reading his brains dried up, causing him to lose his mind. His fantasy filled with everything he had read in his books, enchantments as well as combats, battles, challenges, wounds, courtings, loves, torments, and other impossible foolishness, and those things so occupied his mind that he believed no history could be truer. He said that Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight but not as good as the Knight of the Flaming Sword, who with one slash had cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He preferred Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he had killed Roland the Enchanted, using the same method Hercules used when he suffocated Antaeus, the son of Earth, in his arms. He spoke highly of the giant Morgante, because, though he belonged to the race of arrogant giants, he alone was affable and well-mannered. But he liked Reinaldos de Montalban best of all, especially when he saw him sally forth from his castle to rob everyone he encountered, and when he stole that idol of Mohammed's made of gold in Barbary, as his history relates. He would have given his housekeeper and his niece into the bargain to give the traitor Galalon a good kicking."

Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\n\nMind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him."

To tell\nAbout those woods is hard—so tangled and rough\n\nAnd savage that thinking of it now, I feel\nThe old fear stirring: death is hardly more bitter.\nAnd yet, to treat the good I found there as well\n\nI’ll tell what I saw, though how I came to enter\nI cannot well say, being so full of sleep\nWhatever moment it was I began to blunder\n\nOff the true path. But when I came to stop\nBelow a hill that marked one end of the valley\nThat had pierced my heart with terror, I looked up\n\nToward the crest and saw its shoulders already\nMantled in rays of that planet that leads men\nStraight ahead on every pathway. Then steady\n\nAnd quiet came to the fright of that dawn vigil\nWhen, with the sun, the air changes color little\nBy little, and I could feel no dread, but still\n\nHope to escape from the place where I had strayed,\nSeeing beasts, as I did, blocked the passage uphill:\nThe hour was early in the morning, and the sun\n\nWas climbing up with all those stars that had been\nWith him when Love Divine first set in motion\n\nThose things of beauty. There seemed reason to trust\nThe sweet season with its promise of new green\nFor sign that I would escape from that fell beast\n\nThat barred my way. But fear returned full thrust\nWhen a lion loomed up before me with raging hunger—\nRavenous, mad with hunger—so that the air\n\nSeemed to tremble before him; and then a she-wolf,\nThe scavenger whose scrawny avidities\nHave filled the world with grief time out of mind:\n\nShe drove me back toward the sunless wood\nSo that I shook at the very sight of her.\nComing against me, slowly, step by step,\n\nShe seemed the image of all rapacity.\nMany have lived in misery for her sake.\nAnd I was so afraid that all power to act\n\nDied in me when I saw her slinking near.\nLike a gambler who has only to look\nAt the next cast to know that he has lost\n\nAll he had won, and grieving day by day\nSees all his gains possessed by someone else,\nSo I, remembering those beasts, the lion\n\nAnd wolf, and the terror that froze my breast,\nTurned and moved down toward the dark valley again,\nStep by step, inch by inch. But before I reached\n\nThe bottom someone appeared—so long a mute,\nIt seemed, that he was hoarse—who when I raised\nMy eyes to him, seemed faintly through that gloom\n\nTo call to me: “Have mercy on me,” (whether\nIn pain or death I could not say) “whatever\nYou are, a shade or living man.” He answered:\n\n“Not man; a man once. My parents were both born\nIn Lombardy—Mantua was their native town—\nSub Julio. In the time of false and lying\n\nGods I lived in Rome. Poet was my name.\nI sang in Anchises’ noble son who came\nFrom Troy, when the flames of Ilium’s pride were dying.\n\nBut you, why going back to such unhappiness?\nWhy not climb the mountain of joyousness\nThe beginning and the cause of all our joy?”\n\n“Are you Virgil, then? that spring, that stream, that sea\nOf eloquence?” I asked, bowing humbly.\n“O glory and light to poets, may my love\n\nAnd zeal that searched your work through many years\nAvail me now. You are my teacher, my authority.\nFrom you alone I took the style whose beauty\n\nHas brought me honor. But see that beast arrayed\nThere! Help me to escape her, famous sage!\nShe makes me tremble, the blood throbs in my veins.”\n\nSeeing me weep, he answered, “You must take\nAnother road if you’d escape this savage place,”\nThat beast, the one you fear, lets no one pass\n\nHer way, but blocks him to harass and harry\nSo that she kills him in the end. She's wary,\nHer nature vicious, her appetite so greedy\n\nThat satisfaction never fills the void.\nShe mates with many creatures, yet hungers void\nFor more, till struck by Him and made to dwell\n\nIn Pain: for Pain is her scope and her hell.\nHe shall come down, of whom I shall tell you, then,\n\nOpen Hell’s gate and lead you forth from this\nAbyss, and show you spirits in lament,\nAnd then those in bliss, the second death\n\nUnable to touch; and then the souls for whom\nChrist opened Heaven in triumph over gloom.”"

Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D—— He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D—— since 1806.\n\nAlthough this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.\n\nThe Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of ’93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,—did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.\n\nIn 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Brignolles]. He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\n\nAbout the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy—just what, is not precisely known—took him to Paris. Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Curé, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:—\n\n“Who is this good man who is staring at me?”\n\n“Sire,” said M. Myriel, “you are looking at a good man, and I at a great man. Each of us can profit by it.”\n\nThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D——\n\nWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel’s life? No one knew. Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution."

      "text": "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.\n\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie—no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\n\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears.\n\n“I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm … yes, all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most…. But I am talking too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this last month, lying for days on end in my den thinking … of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s fine features. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food."

I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—’\n\n‘Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,’ he interrupted, wincing. ‘I should not allow any one to inconvenience me if I could hinder it—walk in!’\n\nThe ‘walk in’ was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, ‘Go to the Deuce:’ even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.\n\nWhen he saw my horse’s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the court,—‘Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood’s horse; and bring up some wine.’\n\n‘Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,’ was the reflection suggested by this compound order. ‘No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.’\n\nJoseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy. ‘The Lord help us!’ he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.\n\nWuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. ‘Wuthering’ being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.\n\nBefore passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date ‘1500,’ and the name ‘Hareton Earnshaw.’ I would have asked the owner for a short history of the place, but his attitude at the door seemed to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium."

We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.\n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.”\n\n“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.\n\n“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.”\n\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.\n\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast."

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.\n\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life."

Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.\n\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.\n\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.\n\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)\n\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?"

Socrates and Glaucon are detained by Polemarchus and Adeimantus at Cephalus' house, where Cephalus (elderly, crowned for sacrifice) discusses old age: sorrows stem from human tempers, not age itself; wealth aids happiness but isn't essential (citing Themistocles); true blessing of wealth is living justly to avoid fears of the afterlife. Socrates probes justice as \"telling the truth and paying debts,\" but Cephalus yields to Polemarchus.\n\nPolemarchus, citing Simonides, defines justice as \"doing good to friends and harm to enemies.\" Socrates critiques this: justice must benefit the just man universally (e.g., in peace, contracts); it acts like an art (good at defense and attack, not just harm); equates to \"good to the good, evil to the evil,\" but returning evil produces injustice (unlike horsemanship producing bad riders); traces maxim to tyrants like Periander, not sages; approaches forgiveness.\n\nThrasymachus interrupts, defining justice as \"the interest of the stronger\" (rulers legislate for themselves). Socrates refutes: rulers can err, so not always interest; Cleitophon adds \"what seems interest.\" Analogy to arts: each has interest for its subjects, not self. Thrasymachus diverts: rulers fatten subjects for use (shepherd analogy); unjust profit more (tyrants \"gracious\"); justice loses, injustice gains, especially grand scale.\n\nSocrates counters: inconsistent terms (ruler as self-interested yet infallible); rulers paid (honor/money/punishment), unlike arts; good state avoids office like \"nolo episcopari.\" Glaucon admits Thrasymachus' gains claim needs judge; proposes mutual admissions. Thrasymachus insists perfect injustice more profitable than perfect justice."

The allegory ties into justice as obedience to laws (per Thrasymachus) but critiques it as mere error or ignorance, advocating for philosopher-rulers who descend to guide others.\n\nKey elements include:\n- **The Den**: A metaphor for the sensory world of illusions.\n- **Release and Ascent**: Painful transition to truth, involving stages of adaptation.\n- **Return to the Den**: Philosophers' reluctant return to educate the masses, facing opposition.\n- **Virtues and Soul**: Rational (wisdom), irascible (courage), appetitive (temperance) elements must harmonize.\n- **Thrasymachus' View**: Justice as state obedience; critiqued as ignorance, not true justice.\n- **Philosopher's Role**: Must rule but prefers contemplation; salvation of the state requires their return."

      "text": "How you, O Athenians, have been affected by my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that they almost made me forget who I was—so persuasively did they speak; and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth. But of the many falsehoods told by them, there was one which quite amazed me;—I mean when they said that you should be upon your guard and not allow yourselves to be deceived by the force of my eloquence. To say this, when they were certain to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and proved myself to be anything but a great speaker, did indeed appear to me most shameless—unless by the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth; for if such is their meaning, I admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs! Well, as I was saying, they have scarcely spoken the truth at all; but from me you shall hear the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No, by heaven! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am confident in the justice of my cause (Or, I am certain that I am right in taking this course.): at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the character of a juvenile orator—let no one expect it of me. And I must beg of you to grant me a favour:—If I defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which I have been in the habit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this account. For I am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the first time in a court of law, I am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country:—Am I making an unfair request of you? Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.\n\nAnd first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers, and then I will go on to the later ones. For of old I have had many accusers, who have accused me falsely to you during many years; and I am more afraid of them than of Anytus and his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way. But far more dangerous are the others, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. The disseminators of this tale are the accusers whom I dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that such enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. And they are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were made by them in the days when you were more impressible than you are now—in childhood, or it may have been in youth—and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer. And hardest of all, I do not know and cannot tell the names of my accusers; unless in the chance case of a Comic poet. All who from envy and malice have persuaded you—some of them having first convinced themselves—all this class of men are most difficult to deal with; for I cannot have them up here, and cross-examine them, and therefore I must simply fight with shadows in my own defence, and argue when there is no one who answers. I will ask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that my opponents are of two kinds; one recent, the other ancient: and I hope that you will see the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations you heard long before the others, and much oftener.\n\nWell, then, I must make my defence, and endeavour to clear away in a short time, a slander which has lasted a long time. May I succeed, if to succeed be for my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause! The task is not an easy one; I quite understand the nature of it. And so leaving the event with God, in obedience to the law I will now make my defence.\n\nI will begin at the beginning, and ask what is the accusation which has given rise to the slander of me, and in fact has encouraged Meletus to proof this charge against me. Well, what do the slanderers say? They shall be my prosecutors, and I will sum up their words in an affidavit: “Socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others.” Such is the nature of the accusation: it is just what you have yourselves seen in the comedy of Aristophanes (Aristoph., Clouds.), who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he walks in air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or little—not that I mean to speak disparagingly of any one who is a student of natural philosophy. I should be very sorry if Meletus could bring so grave a charge against me. But the simple truth is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to do with physical speculations. Very many of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this, and to them I appeal. Speak then, you who have heard me, and tell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon such matters...You hear their answer. And from what they say of this part of the charge you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest.\n\nAs little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take money; this accusation has no more truth in it than the other. Although, if a man were really able to instruct mankind, to receive money for giving instruction would, in my opinion, be an honour to him. There is Gorgias of Leontium, and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the cities, and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens by whom they might be taught for nothing, and come to them whom they not only pay, but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them. There is at this time a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard; and I came to hear of him in this way:—I came across a man who has spent a world of money on the Sophists, Callias, the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that he had sons, I asked him: “Callias,” I said, “if your two sons were foals or calves, there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them; we should hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is there any one who understands human and political virtue? You must have thought about the matter, for you have sons; is there any one?” “There is,” he said. “Who is he?” said I; “and of what country? and what does he charge?” “Evenus the Parian,” he replied; “he is the man, and his charge is five minæ.” Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if he really has this wisdom, and teaches at such a moderate charge. Had I the same, I should have been very proud and conceited; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the kind.\n\nI dare say, Athenians, that some one among you will reply, “Yes, Socrates, but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought against you; there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All these rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men: tell us, then, what is the cause of them, for we should be sorry to judge hastily of you.” Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will endeavour to explain to you the reason why I am called wise and have such an evil fame. Please to attend then. And although some of you may think that I am joking, I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of Athens, this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess. If you ask me what kind of wisdom, I reply, wisdom such as may perhaps be attained by man, for to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which I may fail to describe, because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely, and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I must beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant. For the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit; that witness shall be the God of Delphi—he will tell you about my wisdom, if I have any, and of what sort it is. You must have known Chaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the recent exile of the people, and returned with you. Well, Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether—as I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt—he asked the oracle to tell him whether anyone was wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered, that there was no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself; but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of what I am saying.\n\nWhy do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an evil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of his riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What then can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god, and cannot lie; that would be against his nature. After long consideration, I thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, “Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest.” Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed him—his name I need not mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination—and the result was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and still wiser by himself; and thereupon I tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is,—for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him. Then I went to another who had still higher pretensions to wisdom, and my conclusion was exactly the same. Whereupon I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides him.\n\nThen I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon me,—the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first. And I said to myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the oracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!—for I must tell you the truth—the result of my mission was just this: I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less esteemed were really wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the “Herculean” labours, as I may call them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. After the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be instantly detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them—thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to confess the truth, but I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. Then I knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. The poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the politicians.\n\nAt last I went to the artisans. I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things;"

It differs from regal, family, or household government not merely in scale but in constitution: political society involves rotation in magistracy per political science rules, unlike perpetual rule in kingship or patriarchy.\n\n- **Method of Inquiry**: Separate components to first elements (e.g., male-female for propagation via natural impulse; master-slave for mutual safety, with rational beings as governors and bodily ones as slaves; natural superiority of male over female, avoiding artist-like multifunctionality for perfection).\n- **Natural Hierarchies and Societies**:\n  - Domestic: First society (male-female, master-slave; Hesiod: \"First a house, then a wife, then an ox for the plough\"); terms like homosipuoi (Charondas), homokapnoi (Epimenides).\n  - Village: Many families for lasting advantage, ideally descendants (homogalaktes); evolves from family clusters governed by elders (Homer: \"Each one ruled his wife and child\").\n  - City: Union of villages into one society for happy life (beyond mere survival); originally king-ruled due to kinship (like modern barbarian states); gods imagined under kingly rule as men were.\n- **City as Natural and Political Animal**: City perfects government; man is naturally political (unlike solitary, lawless figures in Homer); speech enables justice/unjust perception, forming families/cities (precedes individual, as whole > parts); without law/justice, man is worst (prudence/valour as arms for good/bad).\n- **End and Proof**: City tends to male-female society as end; nature's perfection is its nature (e.g., man/horse/house); produces final cause (happy life); unfit for society are subhuman (beasts) or superhuman (gods)."

      "text": "Book 1 of *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius is a personal journal of philosophical reflections, emphasizing Stoic principles such as living according to nature, self-discipline, acceptance of fate, equanimity amid change, and alignment with the common good. It begins with gratitude for guidance from family, educators, and mentors that shaped his character, organized into numbered sections. The text then shifts to introspective meditations on duty, impermanence, rationality, and harmony with the universe, often written during his time with the Quadi at Granua. Key themes include avoiding unnecessary actions/thoughts, maintaining simplicity, rejecting passions, viewing the world as an ordered cosmos, and preparing for death with contentment. The book underscores that virtue lies in justice, charity, and surrender to providence, while external events are indifferent and transient.\n\n### Part 1: Lessons from Family, Educators, and Mentors\n\nMarcus organizes reflections on influences that instilled moral fiber, focusing on virtues like meekness, simplicity, and rationality. Below is a tabulated summary of key sources and lessons for dense representation:\n\n| Source | Key Lessons and Reflections |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| **Grandfather Verus** | Be gentle, meek; refrain from anger and passion. |\n| **Father** | Shamefastness; manlike behavior; meekness, constancy in decisions; free from vanity in honor; laborious, assiduous; receptive to good ideas; impartial justice; skill in rigor vs. moderation; abstain from youth love; moderate condescension; consistent in tasks; accurate consultations; preserve friends without disdain/fondness; contented, cheerful, foresighted; repress acclamations/flattery; observe government strictly; patient with reprehension; not superstitious, ambitious, or applause-seeking; sober, fitting; enjoy conveniences without pride; honor philosophers without upbraiding; sociable without satiety; body care in bounds; yield to experts; imitate ancestors unnoticeably; constant in places/businesses; recover from headaches vigorously; few secrets (public only); discretion in spectacles/buildings/donations; respect men equitably; no unseasonable baths/builders/curiosity about externals; orderly, sound actions without sweat; like Socrates in handling want/enjoyment moderately; constant in sickness (echoing Maximus). |\n| **Mother** | Religiosity; bountifulness; avoid evil intentions; simple diet; shun excess wealth. |\n| **Great-Grandfather** | Frequent public schools; hire good teachers at home; accept high education costs. |\n| **Upbringing (Guardian/Educator)** | Avoid fanaticism in circus factions (Prasini/Veneti) and gladiatorial games (Parmularii/Secutores); endure labor; need few things; do tasks yourself; avoid meddling in many affairs; reject slander. |\n| **Diognetus** | Avoid vain pursuits, superstition, charms, sorcery; don't keep quails for gaming; tolerate free speech; apply to philosophy; introduced Bacchius, Tandasis, Marcianus; wrote dialogues in youth; interest in philosophical practices (couch, skins). |\n| **Rusticus** | Recognize life's need for redress; avoid sophistry, public orations, ostentatious exercises; give up rhetoric, poetry, elegant language; write plain letters (e.g., Sinuessa); reconcile easily with offenders; diligent reading (not superficial); discovered Epictetus' *Hypomnemata*. |\n| **Apollonius** | True liberty; steadfastness; adhere to right/reason in pain/loss; example of vehement yet remiss; not vexed by students; modest in teaching; receive favors without obligation/ingratitude. |\n| **Sextus** | Mildness; paternal family governance; live per nature; grave without affectation; observe friends' dispositions; not offended by fools/vulgar opinions; accommodate all sweetly/respectfully; skilled in life instructions; unpassionate yet tender; credible without rumor; learned yet unshowy. |\n| **Alexander the Grammarian** | Avoid reproaching barbarisms/solecisms; correct indirectly by rephrasing civilly. |\n| **Fronto** | Tyrannical rule's envy, fraud, hypocrisy; nobility's lack of natural affection. |\n| **Alexander the Platonic** | Rarely say/write \"I am not at leisure\" to delay duties to friends. |\n| **Catulus** | Don't contemn friends' unjust complaints; restore their disposition; praise masters freely; love children sincerely. |\n| **Brother Severus** | Kindness to family; introduced Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dio, Brutus; ideal equal commonwealth by justice; constant philosophy study; bountiful, hopeful, confident in friends; open reproof. |\n| **Claudius Maximus** | Self-mastery; cheerfulness in accidents (e.g., sickness); love mildness, moderation, gravity; thorough work without querulousness; credible, good-intent actions; never wonder, haste, laugh excessively, anger, suspect; ready to good, forgive, truth; pleasant, gracious. |\n| **From the Gods/Fortune** | Good ancestors, parents, sister, masters, domestics, kinsmen; no transgressions via rashness (prevented by mercy); not long with father's concubine; preserved youth's flower; lived under father's diligent rule (without guards/ostentation); good brother inspiring self-reflection; ingenuous, undeformed children; no rhetoric/poetry proficiency (successful elsewhere); promoted upbringings deservedly; knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; meditated on natural life (could begin earlier); strong body; no affairs with Benedicta/Theodotus (cured quickly); no repentance toward Rusticus; mother lived latter years; sufficient aid for poor; obedient, loving wife; fit child-upbringers; dream helps (e.g., Cajeta, Chryses); avoided sophists, ordinary philosophies, fallacies, meteor studies; all via gods/fortune. |\n\nThese lessons emphasize moral formation through example, rejecting excesses, and prioritizing philosophy, justice, and simplicity."

      "source": "Epictetus - Enchiridion",
      "text": "There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.\n\nNow the things within our power are by nature free, unrestricted, unhindered; but those beyond our power are weak, dependent, restricted, alien. Remember, then, that if you attribute freedom to things by nature dependent and take what belongs to others for your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you take for your own only that which is your own and view what belongs to others just as it really is, then no one will ever compel you, no one will restrict you; you will find fault with no one, you will accuse no one, you will do nothing against your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have an enemy, nor will you suffer any harm.\n\nAiming, therefore, at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself any inclination, however slight, toward the attainment of the others; but that you must entirely quit some of them, and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would have these, and possess power and wealth likewise, you may miss the latter in seeking the former; and you will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness and freedom are procured.\n\nSeek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, “You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.” And then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and chiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.\n\nRemember that desire demands the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion demands the avoidance of that to which you are averse; that he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed; and he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched. If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power. But for the present, altogether restrain desire; for if you desire any of the things not within our own power, you must necessarily be disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our power, and so are legitimate objects of desire. Where it is practically necessary for you to pursue or avoid anything, do even this with discretion and gentleness and moderation.\n\nWith regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of which you are fond of—for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that you embrace a mortal—and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.\n\nWhen you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, represent to yourself the incidents usual in the bath—some persons pouring out, others pushing in, others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, “I will now go to bathe and keep my own will in harmony with nature.” And so with regard to every other action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing, you will be able to say, “It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus if I am out of humor at things that happen.”\n\nMen are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves—that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.\n\nBe not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be elated, and say, “I am handsome,” it might be endurable. But when you are elated and say, “I have a handsome horse,” know that you are elated only on the merit of the horse. What then is your own? The use of the phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own.\n\nAs in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get water, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle in your way, but your thoughts ought to be bent toward the ship, and perpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must leave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board the vessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go far from the ship, lest you should be missing when called for.\n\nDemand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.\n\nSickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless itself pleases. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will; and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself.\n\nUpon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you will find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience. And when thus habituated, the phenomena of existence will not overwhelm you.\n\nNever say of anything, “I have lost it,” but, “I have restored it.” Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. “But it was a bad man who took it.” What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as something not your own, as do travelers at an inn.\n\nIf you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.” For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.\n\nBegin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilled or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, “This is the price paid for peace and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.” And when you call your servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should be in his power to cause you any disturbance.\n\nIf you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. For be assured, it is not easy at once to keep your will in harmony with nature and to secure externals; but while you are absorbed in the one, you must of necessity neglect the other.\n\nIf you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so, and what belongs to others to be your own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are foolish, for you wish vice not to be vice but something else. But if you wish not to be disappointed in your desires, that is in your own power. Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man’s master is he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.\n\nRemember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized.\n\nWhen you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say, “What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself—for another man might not be hurt by it—but the view he chooses to take of it.” As far as conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him and, if need be, to groan with him. Take heed, however, not to groan inwardly, too.\n\nRemember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses—if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business—to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.\n\nWhen a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by appearances, but discriminate and say, “Nothing is portended to _me_, either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to _me_ all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to derive advantage therefrom.”\n\nYou can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be bewildered by appearances and to pronounce him happy; for if the essence of good consists in things within our own power, there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own power.\n\nRemember that it is not he who gives abuse or blows, who affronts, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be bewildered by appearances. For if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself.\n\nLet death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain an abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.\n\nIf you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, “He is returned to us a philosopher all at once”; and, “Whence this supercilious look?” Now, for your part, do not have a supercilious look indeed, but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you, as one appointed by God to this particular station. For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.\n\nIf you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you wish to seem so likewise to anyone, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you.\n\nLet not such considerations as these distress you: “I shall live in discredit and be nobody anywhere.” For if discredit be an evil, you can no more be involved in evil through another than in baseness. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How then, after all, is this discredit? And how it is true that you will be nobody anywhere when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are within your own power, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? “But my friends will be unassisted.” What do you mean by “unassisted”? They will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these are among the things within our own power, and not rather the affairs of others? And who can give to another the things which he himself has not? “Well, but get them, then, that we too"

Make yourself believe the truth of my words,—that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose. **2.** What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years lie behind us are in death’s hands.\n\nTherefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day’s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow’s. While we are postponing, life speeds by. **3.** Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,—time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.\n\n**4.** You may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess frankly: my expense account balances, as you would expect from one who is free-handed but careful. I cannot boast that I waste nothing, but I can at least tell you what I am wasting, and the cause and manner of the loss; I can give you the reasons why I am a poor man. My situation, however, is the same as that of many who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: every one forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.\n\n**5.** What is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask.

And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations\nthat I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure\nconstrained to advert to them. I had long before remarked that, in\nrelation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above\ndoubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been\nalready said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the\nsearch after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was\ncalled for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions\nin regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order\nto ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that\nwas wholly indubitable. Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes\ndeceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really\nsuch as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning,\nand fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I,\nconvinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false\nall the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and\nfinally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations)\nwhich we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are\nasleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed\nthat all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind\nwhen awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams.\nBut immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to\nthink that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus\nthought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I\nthink, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such\nevidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged\nby the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might,\nwithout scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of\nwhich I was in search.\n\nIn the next place, I attentively examined what I was and as I observed\nthat I could suppose that I had no body, and that there was no world\nnor any place in which I might be; but that I could not therefore\nsuppose that I was not; and that, on the contrary, from the very\ncircumstance that I thought to doubt of the truth of other things, it\nmost clearly and certainly followed that I was; while, on the other\nhand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects\nwhich I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have\nhad no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was\na substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking,\nand which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on\nany material thing; so that “I,” that is to say, the mind by which I am\nwhat I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is even more easily\nknown than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not,\nit would still continue to be all that it is.\n\nAfter this I inquired in general into what is essential to the truth\nand certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I\nknew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the\nground of this certitude. And as I observed that in the words I think,\ntherefore I am, there is nothing at all which gives me assurance of\ntheir truth beyond this, that I see very clearly that in order to think\nit is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take, as a general\nrule, the principle, that all the things which we very clearly and\ndistinctly conceive are true, only observing, however, that there is\nsome difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly\nconceive."

Locke's empirical physiology offered hope but failed, reverting to dogmatism and indifference (chaos prelude to re-creation). Indifference is vain and ignores humanity's stake; it's a call for self-examination via critical investigation of pure reason.\n\nKey aims: Solve errors in non-empirical thought; determine metaphysics' possibility, origin, extent, limits on principled grounds.

Form: Certitude (exclude hypotheses; adduce grounds) and clearness (discursive/logical via conceptions; intuitive/æsthetic via examples, but examples omitted for brevity as work is not popular). Deduction of categories: Objective (validity for experience) essential; subjective (understanding's possibility) secondary (resembles hypothesis but isn't). Complaints of shallow age unfounded (math/physics secure); indifference signs profound thought. Age of criticism subjects all (even religion/legislation) to examination for respect."

His works, including these essays, support his main thesis on the metaphysics of the world (detailed chiefly in \"Metaphysics of Love\"), but can stand independently as valuable life criticisms from a worldly observer with inspired perception. Unlike academic philosophers, Schopenhauer observed life firsthand without echoes of schools; his voice was deep, convincing, and epigrammatic, akin to Molière, using paradoxes (many now truisms) to illuminate truth—quoting \"Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable.\" A grim humorist, he dissected the mind's hypocrisies, but his candor hindered social favor, as society relies on evasions and illusions; plain-speakers provide necessary disillusionment, though one must temper their lessons by considering temperament and vision. Schopenhauer's hypochondriac family history (insane grandmother, mentally incapacitated siblings, suicidal father, mother's \"individual\" choice affecting offspring) suggests a taint, yet his clear, original insight—seeing for himself—marks genius. The world gains a whimsical, sensitive, egotistical personality: isolated, self-absorbed, a hermit-boulevardier whose intellectual life endures, speaking timelessly like Lamb or Walton, interesting for honesty, independence, and naïveté, if mistaken at times.

      "text": "I can readily imagine, Holy Father, that as soon as some people hear that in this volume, which I have written about the revolutions of the spheres of the universe, I ascribe certain motions to the terrestrial globe, they will shout that I must be immediately repudiated together with this belief For I am not so enamored of my own opinions that I disregard what others may think of them. I am aware that a philosopher's ideas are not subject to the judgement of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavor to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God. Yet I hold that completely erroneous views should be shunned. Those who know that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the conception that the earth remains at rest in the middle of the heaven as its center would, I reflected, regard it as an insane pronouncement if I made the opposite assertion that the earth moves. Therefore I debated with myself for a long time whether to publish the volume which I wrote to prove the earth's motion or rather to follow the example of the Pythagoreans and certain others, who used to transmit philosophy's secrets only to kinsmen and friends, not in writing but by word of mouth, as is shown by Lysis' letter to Hipparchus. And they did so, it seems to me, not, as some suppose, because they were in some way jealous about their teachings, which would be spread around; on the contrary, they wanted the very beautiful thoughts attained by great men of deep devotion not to be ridiculed by those who are reluctant to exert themselves vigorously in any literary pursuit unless it is lucrative; or if they are stimulated to the nonacquisitive study of philosophy by the exhortation and example of others, yet because of their dullness of mind they play the same part among philosophers as drones among bees. When I weighed these considerations, the scorn which I had reason to fear on account of the novelty and unconventionality of my opinion almost induced me to abandon completely the work which I had undertaken. But while I hesitated for a long time and even resisted, my friends drew me back. Foremost among them was the cardinal of Capua, Nicholas Schönberg, renowned in every field of learning. Next to him was a man who loves me dearly, Tiedemann Giese, bishop of Chelmno, a close student of sacred letters as well as of all good literature. For he repeatedly encouraged me and, sometimes adding reproaches, urgently requested me to publish this volume and finally permit it to appear after being buried among my papers and lying concealed not merely until the ninth year but by now the fourth period of nine years. The same conduct was recommended to me by not a few other very eminent scholars. They exhorted me no longer to refuse, on account of the fear which I felt, to make my work available for the general use of students of astronomy. Ile crazier my doctrine of the earth's motion now appeared to most people, the argument ran, so much the more admiration and thanks would it gain after they saw the publication of my writings dispel the fog of absurdity by most luminous proofs. Influenced therefore by these persuasive men and by this hope, in the end I allowed my friends to bring out an edition of the volume, as they had long besought me to do. However, Your Holiness will perhaps not be greatly surprised that I have dared to publish my studies after devoting so much effort to working them out that I did not hesitate to put down my thoughts about the earth's motion in written fcrm too. But you are rather waiting to hear from me how it occurred to me to venture to conceive any motion of the earth, against the traditional opinion of astronomers and almost against common sense. I have accordingly no desire to from Your Holiness that I was impelled to consider a different system of deducing the motions of the universe's spheres for no other reason than the realization that astronomers do not agree among themselves in their investigations of this subject. For, in the first place, they are so uncertain about the motion of the sun and moon that they cannot establish and observe a constant length even for the tropical year. Secondly, in determining the motions not only of these bodies but also of the other five planets, they do not use the same principles, assumptions, and explanations of the apparent revolutions and motions. For while some employ only homocentrics, others utilize eccentrics and epicycles, and yet they do not quite reach their goal. For although those who put their faith in homocentrics showed that some nonuniform motions could be compounded in this way, nevertheless by this means they were unable to obtain any incontrovertible result in absolute agreement with the phenomena. On the other hand, those who devised the eccentrics seem thereby in large measure to have solved the problem of the apparent motions with appropriate calculations. But meanwhile they introduced a good many ideas which apparently contradict the first principles of uniform motion. Nor could they elicit or deduce from the eccentrics the principal consideration, that is, the structure of the universe and the true symmetry of its parts. On the contrary, their experience was just like some one taking from various places hands, feet, a head, and other pieces, very well depicted, it may be, but not for the representation of a single person; since these fragments would not belong to one another at all, a monster rather than a man would be put together from them. Hence in the process of demonstration or \"method\", as it is called, those who employed eccentrics are found either to have omitted something essential or to have admitted something extraneous and wholly irrelevant. This would not have happened to them, had they followed sound principles. For if the hypotheses assumed by them were not false, everything which follows from their hypotheses would be confirmed beyond any doubt. Even though what I am now saying may be obscure, it will nevertheless become clearer in the proper place. For a long time, then, I reflected on this confusion in the astronomical traditions concerning the derivation of the motions of the universe's spheres. I began to be annoyed that the movements of the world machine, created for our sake by the best and most systematic Artisan of all, were not understood with greater certainty by the philosophers, who otherwise examined so precisely the most insignificant trifles of this world. For this reason I undertook the task of rereading the works of all the philosophers which I could obtain to learn whether anyone had ever proposed other motions of the universe's spheres than those expounded by the teachers of astronomy in the schools. And in fact first I found in Cicero that Hicetas supposed the earth to move. Later I also discovered in Plutarch that certain others were of this opinion. I have decided to set his words down here, so that they may be available to everybody: Some think that the earth remains at rest. But Philolaus the Pythagorean believes that, like the sun and moon, it revolves around the fire in an oblique circle. Heraclides of Pontus, and Ecphantus the Pythagorean make the earth move, not in a progressive motion, but like a wheel in a rotation from west to east about its own center. Therefore, having obtained the opportunity from these sources, I too began to consider the mobility of the earth. And even though the idea seemed absurd, nevertheless I knew that others before me had been granted the freedom to imagine any circles whatever for the purpose of explaining the heavenly phenomena. Hence I thought that I too would be readily permitted to ascertain whether explanations sounder than those of my predecessors could be found for the revolution of the celestial spheres on the assumption of some motion of the earth. Having thus assumed the motions which I ascribe to the earth later on in the volume, by long and intense study I finally found that if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth, and are computed for the revolution of each planet, not only do their phenomena follow therefrom but also the order and size of all the planets and spheres, and heaven itself is so linked together that in no portion of it can anything be shifted without disrupting the remaining parts and the universe as a whole. Accordingly in the arrangement of the volume too I have adopted the following order. In the first book I set forth the entire distribution of the spheres together with the motions which I attribute to the earth, so that this book contains, as it were, the general structure of the universe. Then in the remaining books I correlate the motions of the other planets and of all the spheres with the movement of the earth so that I may thereby determine to what extent the motions and appearances of the other planets and spheres can be saved if they are correlated with the earth's motions. I have no doubt that acute and learned astronomers will agree with me if, as this discipline especially requires, they are willing to examine and consider, not superficially but thoroughly, what I adduce in this volume in proof of these matters. However, in order that the educated and uneducated alike may see that I do not run away from the judgement of anybody at all, I have preferred dedicating my studies to Your Holiness rather than to anyone else. For even in this very remote comer of the earth where I live you are considered the highest authority by virtue of the loftiness of your office and your love for all literature and astronomy too. Hence by your prestige and judgement you can easily suppress calumnious attacks although, as the proverb has it, there is no remedy for a backbite. Perhaps there will be babblers who claim to be judges of astronomy although completely ignorant of the subject and, badly distorting some passage of Scripture to their purpose, will dare to find fault with my undertaking and censure it. I disregard them even to the extent of despising their criticism as unfounded. For it is not unknown that Lactantius, otherwise an illustrious writer but hardly an astronomer, speaks quite childishly about the earth's shape, when he mocks those who declared that the earth has the form of a globe. Hence scholars need not be surprised if any such persons will likewise ridicule me. Astronomy is written for astronomers. To them my work too will seem, unless I am mistaken, to make some contribution also to the Church, at the head of which Your Holiness now stands. For not so long ago under Leo X the Lateran Council considered the problem of reforming the ecclesiastical calendar. The issue remained undecided then only because the lengths of the year and month and the motions of the sun and moon were regarded as not yet adequately measured. From that time on, at the suggestion of that most distinguished man, Paul, bishop of Fossombrone, who was then in charge of this matter, I have directed my attention to a more precise study of these topics. But what I have accomplished in this regard, I leave to the judgement of Your Holiness in particular and of all other learned astronomers. And lest I appear to Your Holiness to promise more about the usefulness of this volume than I can fulfill, I now turn to the work itself."

I have taken this subject on a former occasion; and were it left to my own will, I should prefer to repeat it almost every year—so abundant is the interest that attaches itself to the subject, so wonderful are the varieties of outlet which it offers into the various departments of philosophy. There is not a law under which any part of this universe is governed which does not come into play, and is touched upon in these phenomena. There is no better, there is no more open door by which you can enter into the study of natural philosophy, than by considering the physical phenomena of a candle. I trust, therefore, I shall not disappoint you in choosing this for my subject rather than any newer topic, which could not be better, were it even so good.\n\nAnd before proceeding, let me say this also—that though our subject be so great, and our intention that of treating it honestly, seriously, and philosophically, yet I mean to pass away from all those who are seniors amongst us. I claim the privilege of speaking to juveniles as a juvenile myself. I have done so on former occasions—and, if you please, I shall do so again. And though I stand here with the knowledge of having the words I utter given to the world, yet that shall not deter me from speaking in the same familiar way to those whom I esteem nearest to me on this occasion.\n\nAnd now, my boys and girls, I must first tell you of what candles are made. Some are great curiosities. I have here some bits of timber, branches of trees particularly famous for their burning. And here you see a piece of that very curious substance taken out of some of the bogs in Ireland, called _candle-wood_,—a hard, strong, excellent wood, evidently fitted for good work as a resister of force, and yet withal burning so well that where it is found they make splinters of it, and torches, since it burns like a candle, and gives a very good light indeed. And in this wood we have one of the most beautiful illustrations of the general nature of a candle that I can possibly give. The fuel provided, the means of bringing that fuel to the place of chemical action, the regular and gradual supply of air to that place of action—heat and light—all produced by a little piece of wood of this kind, forming, in fact, a natural candle.\n\nBut we must speak of candles as they are in commerce. Here are a couple of candles commonly called dips. They are made of lengths of cotton cut off, hung up by a loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again and cooled, then re-dipped until there is an accumulation of tallow round the cotton. In order that you may have an idea of the various characters of these candles, you see these which I hold in my hand—they are very small, and very curious. They are, or were, the candles used by the miners in coal mines. In olden times the miner had to find his own candles; and it was supposed that a small candle would not so soon set fire to the fire-damp in the coal mines as a large one; and for that reason, as well as for economy’s sake, he had candles made of this sort—20, 30, 40, or 60 to the pound. They have been replaced since then by the steel-mill, and then by the Davy-lamp, and other safety-lamps of various kinds. I have here a candle that was taken out of the _Royal George_[1], it is said, by Colonel Pasley. It has been sunk in the sea for many years, subject to the action of salt water. It shews you how well candles may be preserved; for though it is cracked about and broken a good deal, yet, when lighted, it goes on burning regularly, and the tallow resumes its natural condition as soon as it is fused.\n\nMr. Field, of Lambeth, has supplied me abundantly with beautiful illustrations of the candle and its materials. I shall therefore now refer to them. And, first, there is the suet—the fat of the ox—Russian tallow, I believe, employed in the manufacture of these dips, which Gay Lussac, or some one who entrusted him with his knowledge, converted into that beautiful substance, stearin, which you see lying beside it. A candle, you know, is not now a greasy thing like an ordinary tallow candle, but a clean thing, and you may almost scrape off and pulverise the drops which fall from it without soiling anything. This is the process he adopted[2]:—The fat or tallow is first boiled with quick-lime, and made into a soap, and then the soap is decomposed by sulphuric acid, which takes away the lime, and leaves the fat re-arranged as stearic acid, whilst a quantity of glycerin is produced at the same time. Glycerin—absolutely a sugar, or a substance similar to sugar—comes out of the tallow in this chemical change. The oil is then pressed out of it; and you see here this series of pressed cakes, shewing how beautifully the impurities are carried out by the oily part as the pressure goes on increasing, and at last you have left that substance which is melted, and cast into candles as here represented. The candle I have in my hand is a stearin candle, made of stearin from tallow in the way I have told you. Then here is a sperm candle, which comes from the purified oil of the spermaceti whale. Here also are yellow bees-wax and refined bees-wax, from which candles are made. Here, too, is that curious substance called paraffin, and some paraffin candles made of paraffin obtained from the bogs of Ireland. I have here also a substance brought from Japan, since we have forced an entrance into that out-of-the-way place—a sort of wax which a kind friend has sent me, and which forms a new material for the manufacture of candles.\n\nAnd how are these candles made? I have told you about dips, and I will shew you how moulds are made. Let us imagine any of these candles to be made of materials which can be cast. “Cast!” you say. “Why, a candle is a thing that melts; and surely if you can melt it, you can cast it.” Not so. It is wonderful, in the progress of manufacture, and in the consideration of the means best fitted to produce the required result, how things turn up which one would not expect beforehand. Candles cannot always be cast. A wax candle can never be cast. It is made by a particular process, which I can illustrate in a minute or two: but I must not spend much time on it. Wax is a thing which, burning so well, and melting so easily in a candle, cannot be cast. However, let us take a material that can be cast. Here is a frame, with a number of moulds fastened in it. The first thing to be done is to put a wick through them. Here is one—a plaited wick, which does not require snuffing[3]—supported by a little wire. It goes to the bottom, where it is pegged in—the little peg holding the cotton tight, and stopping the aperture, so that nothing fluid shall run out. At the upper part there is a little bar placed across, which stretches the cotton and holds it in the mould. The tallow is then melted, and the moulds are filled. After a certain time, when the moulds are cool, the excess of tallow is poured off at one corner, and then cleaned off altogether, and the ends of the wick cut away. The candles alone then remain in the mould, and you have only to upset them, as I am doing, when out they tumble, for the candles are made in the form of cones, being narrower at the top than at the bottom; so that what with their form and their own shrinking, they only need a little shaking, and out they fall. In the same way are made these candles of stearin and of paraffin. It is a curious thing to see how wax candles are made. A lot of cottons are hung upon frames, as you see here, and covered with metal tags at the ends to keep the wax from covering the cotton in those places. These are carried to a heater, where the wax is melted. As you see, the frames can turn round; and as they turn, a man takes a vessel of wax and pours it first down one, and then the next and the next, and so on. When he has gone once round, if it is sufficiently cool, he gives the first a second coat, and so on until they are all of the required thickness. When they have been thus clothed, or fed, or made up to that thickness, they are taken off, and placed elsewhere. I have here, by the kindness of Mr. Field, several specimens of these candles. Here is one only half-finished. They are then taken down, and well rolled upon a fine stone slab, and the conical top is moulded by properly shaped tubes, and the bottoms cut off and trimmed. This is done so beautifully that they can make candles in this way weighing exactly four, or six, to the pound, or any number they please.\n\nWe must not, however, take up more time about the mere manufacture, but go a little further into the matter. I have not yet referred you to luxuries in candles (for there is such a thing as luxury in candles). See how beautifully these are coloured: you see here mauve, magenta, and all the chemical colours recently introduced, applied to candles. You observe, also, different forms employed. Here is a fluted pillar most beautifully shaped; and I have also here some candles sent me by Mr. Pearsall, which are ornamented with designs upon them, so that as they burn you have as it were a glowing sun above, and a bouquet of flowers beneath. All, however, that is fine and beautiful is not useful. These fluted candles, pretty as they are, are bad candles; they are bad because of their external shape. Nevertheless, I shew you these specimens sent to me from kind friends on all sides, that you may see what is done, and what may be done in this or that direction; although, as I have said, when we come to these refinements, we are obliged to sacrifice a little in utility.\n\nNow, as to the light of the candle. We will light one or two, and set them at work in the performance of their proper functions. You observe a candle is a very different thing from a lamp. With a lamp you take a little oil, fill your vessel, put in a little moss or some cotton prepared by artificial means, and then light the top of the wick. When the flame runs down the cotton to the oil, it gets extinguished, but it goes on burning in the part above. Now, I have no doubt you will ask, how is it that the oil, which will not burn of itself, gets up to the top of the cotton, where it will burn? We shall presently examine that; but there is a much more wonderful thing about the burning of a candle than this. You have here a solid substance with no vessel to contain it; and how is it that this solid substance can get up to the place where the flame is? How is it that this solid gets there, it not being a fluid? or, when it is made a fluid, then how is it that it keeps together? This is a wonderful thing about a candle.\n\nWe have here a good deal of wind, which will help us in some of our illustrations, but tease us in others; for the sake, therefore, of a little regularity, and to simplify the matter, I shall make a quiet flame—for who can study a subject when there are difficulties in the way not belonging to it? Here is a clever invention of some costermonger or street stander in the market-place for the shading of their candles on Saturday nights, when they are selling their greens, or potatoes, or fish. I have very often admired it. They put a lamp-glass round the candle, supported on a kind of gallery, which clasps it, and it can be slipped up and down as required. By the use of this lamp-glass, employed in the same way, you have a steady flame, which you can look at, and carefully examine, as I hope you will do, at home.\n\nYou see, then, in the first instance, that a beautiful cup is formed. As the air comes to the candle it moves upwards by the force of the current which the heat of the candle produces, and it so cools all the sides of the wax, tallow, or fuel, as to keep the edge much cooler than the part within; the part within"

Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was good and kind to all about her. And the snow spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. 'What does the good-for-nothing want in the parlour?' said they; 'they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen-maid!' Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her into the kitchen.\n\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. The sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\n\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife's daughters what he should bring them. 'Fine clothes,' said the first; 'Pearls and diamonds,' cried the second. 'Now, child,' said he to his own daughter, 'what will you have?' 'The first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards,' said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to her mother's grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.\n\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself. Ashputtel's two sisters were invited to come; so they called her up, and said, 'Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our girdles for us, for we are going to dance at the king's feast.' Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go. 'You, Ashputtel!' said she; 'you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance—you want to go to the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, 'I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours' time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too.'\n\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\n\n'Hither, hither, through the sky,\nTurtle-doves and linnets, fly!\nBlackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\nHither, hither, haste away!\nOne and all come help me, quick!\nHaste ye, haste ye!—pick, pick, pick!'\n\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes. And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite done, and all flew out again at the windows.\n\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, 'No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.' And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, 'If you can in one hour's time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.' And thus she thought she should at last get rid of her. So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\n\nBut the maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:\n\n'Hither, hither, through the sky,\nTurtle-doves and linnets, fly!\nBlackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\nHither, hither, haste away!\nOne and all come help me, quick!\nHaste ye, haste ye!—pick, pick, pick!'\n\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes, and left the ashes. Before half an hour's time was over the work was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to know that she should now go to the ball. But she said, 'It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame': and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.\n\nThen the child went to her mother's grave and cried,\n\n'Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\nGold and silver over me!'\n\nAnd the little bird threw down an even more splendid dress than the one she had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king's son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, 'This lady is dancing with me.'\n\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king's son followed her as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father's house. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. Then the king's son lost sight of her, and waited until her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden, who had danced with him, had leapt into the pigeon-house. Then he thought, 'Can it be Ashputtel?' so he had an axe brought; and they cut down the pigeon-house, but no one was in it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there sat Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey frock.\n\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her mother and sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said,\n\n'Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\nGold and silver over me!'\n\nAnd the bird threw down a much grander dress than the first, and slippers of pure gold; and when she came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king's son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance, he said, 'This lady is my partner, sir.'\n\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king's son would go with her, and said to himself, 'I will not lose her this time'; but, however, she again sprang away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.\n\nThe king's son took it up, but it was quite small and dainty, and all golden. The next day he went with it to the man, and said, 'No one shall be my wife except she whose foot this golden slipper fits.'\n\nThen both the sisters were glad, for they had beautiful feet. The eldest went into a room to try the slipper on, and her mother stood by. But the great toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, 'Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.' So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe, and went to the king's son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\n\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\n\n'Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\nThe shoe is too small, and not made for you!\nPrince! prince! look again for thy bride,\nFor she's not the true one that sits by thy side.'\n\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home, and said, 'This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.' Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king's son: and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\n\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still, and sang:\n\n'Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\nThe shoe is too small, and not made for you!\nPrince! prince! look again for thy bride,\nFor she's not the true one that sits by thy side.'\n\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse and brought her also back again. 'This is not the true bride,' said he to the father; 'have you no other daughter?' 'No,' said he; 'there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.' The prince told him to send her to him, but the mother answered, 'Oh, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself.' However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtseyed to him, and he reached her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, 'This is the right bride.' But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on the horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the dove sang:\n\n'Home! home! look to the bride's shoe!\nPrince! this is the true bride for you!'"

      "text": "Once upon a time in midwinter, when the snowflakes were falling like feathers from heaven, a queen sat sewing at her window, which had a frame of black ebony wood. As she sewed she looked up at the snow and pricked her finger with her needle, and a drop of blood fell on the snow. The red on the white looked so beautiful that she thought to herself, \"If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood in this frame.\"\n\nSoon afterward she had a little daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and therefore they called her Little Snow-white. And as soon as the child was born, the queen died.\n\nWhen the child was a year old, the king took another wife. It was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and arrogant, and she could not stand it if anyone might surpass her in beauty. She had a magic mirror. Every morning she stood before it, looked at herself, and said:\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall,\nWho in this land is fairest of all?\n\nTo this the mirror answered:\n\nYou, my queen, are fairest of all.\n\nThen she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.\n\nSnow-white grew up and became ever more beautiful. When she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the light of day, even more beautiful than the queen herself.\n\nOne day when the queen asked her mirror:\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall,\nWho in this land is fairest of all?\n\nIt answered:\n\nYou, my queen, are fair; it is true.\nBut Snow-white is a thousand times fairer than you.\n\nThe queen took fright and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour on whenever she looked at Snow-white her heart turned over inside her body, so great was her hatred for the girl. The envy and pride grew ever greater, like a weed in her heart, until she had no peace day and night.\n\nThen she summoned a huntsman and said to him, \"Take Snow-white out into the woods. I never want to see her again. Kill her, and as proof that she is dead bring her lungs and liver back to me.\"\n\nThe huntsman obeyed and took Snow-white out into the woods. He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart when she began to cry, saying, \"Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come home.\"\n\nBecause she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he thought, \"The wild animals will soon devour you anyway.\"\n\nBut it was as if a stone had been rolled away from his heart when he did not kill her. Just then a young boar came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of Snow-white's death. The cook had to boil them with salt, and the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-white's lungs and liver.\n\nThe poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do. Then she began to run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm. She ran as far as her feet could carry her until it was almost evening, when she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest. Inside the house everything was small, but so neat and clean that no one could say otherwise. There was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven little plates, and each plate had a little spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and seven mugs as well. Against the wall there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white sheets.\n\nBecause she was so hungry and thirsty Snow-white ate a little bit of vegetables and bread from each little plate and drank a drop of wine from each mug, for she did not want to take everything from just one. Then, because she was so tired, she lay down in one bed after the other, but none of them was right: one was too long, the other too short. The seventh one, however, was just right, and so she stayed in it, said her prayers, and fell asleep.\n\nWhen it was completely dark, the masters of the little house came home. They were seven dwarfs who picked and dug for ore in the mountains. They lit their seven little candles, and as soon as it was light in their house they saw that someone had been there, for not everything was in the same order as they had left it.\n\nThe first one said, \"Who has been sitting in my chair?\"\n\nThe second one, \"Who has been eating from my plate?\"\n\nThe third one, \"Who has been eating my bread?\"\n\nThe fourth one, \"Who has been eating my vegetables?\"\n\nThe fifth one, \"Who has been sticking with my fork?\"\n\nThe sixth one, \"Who has been cutting with my knife?\"\n\nThe seventh one, \"Who has been drinking from my mug?\"\n\nThen the first one saw a that there was a little imprint in his bed, and said, \"Who stepped on my bed?\"\n\nThe others came running up and shouted, \"Someone has been lying in mine as well.\"\n\nBut the seventh one, looking at his bed, found Snow-white lying there asleep. The seven dwarfs all came running up, and they cried out with amazement. They fetched their seven candles and shone the light on Snow-white. \"Oh good heaven! Oh good heaven!\" they cried. \"This child is so beautiful!\"\n\nThey were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed. The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his companions, one hour with each one, and then the night was done."

      "text": "Near a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife, and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel and the girl's Grethel. They had very little to bite or to sup, and once, when there was great dearth in the land, the man could not even gain the daily bread. As he lay in bed one night thinking of this, and turning and tossing, he sighed heavily, and said to his wife, \"What will become of us? we cannot even feed our children; there is nothing left for ourselves?\"\n\n\"I will tell you what, husband,\" answered the wife; \"we will take the children early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of bread, then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will never find the way home again, and we shall be quit of them.\"\n\n\"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I cannot do that; I cannot find in my heart to take my children into the forest and leave them there alone; the wild animals would soon come and devour them.\" \"Oh you fool,\" said she, \"then we will all four starve; you had better get the coffins ready,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I really pity the poor children,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had been unable to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \"It is all over with us.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Grethel,\" said Hansel, \"do not fret; I will manage something.\" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up, put on his little coat, opened the back door, and slipped out. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles that lay in front of the house glistened like real silver coins. Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of his coat as full as it would hold. Then he went back again, and said to Grethel, \"Be easy, dear little sister, and sleep quietly; God will not forsake us,\" and laid himself down again in his bed.\n\nWhen the day was breaking, and before the sun had risen, the wife came and awakened the two children, saying, \"Get up, you lazy bones; we are going into the forest to cut wood.\" Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said, \"That is for dinner, and you must not eat it before then, for you will get no more.\" Grethel carried the bread under her apron, for Hansel had his pockets full of the pebbles. Then they set off all together on their way to the forest. When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked back towards the house, and this he did again and again, till his father said to him, \"Hansel, what are you looking at? take care not to forget your legs.\"\n\n\"Oh father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white kitten, who is sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye.\" \"You young fool,\" said the woman, \"that is not your kitten, but the sunshine on the chimney-pot.\" Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten, but had been taking every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road.\n\nWhen they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children to collect wood to make a fire to keep them warm; and Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain; and it was set on fire, and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said, \"Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves, we will go and cut wood; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you.\"\n\nSo Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and at noon they each ate their pieces of bread. They thought their father was in the wood all the time, as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe: but really it was only a dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro. So when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids began to close with tiredness, and they fell asleep. When at last they woke it was night, and Grethel began to cry, and said, \"How shall we ever get out of this wood?\" But Hansel comforted her, saying, \"Wait a little till the full moon rises, and then we can easily find the way home.\"\n\nAnd when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver, and showed them the road. They walked on the whole night through, and at the break of day they came to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel she said, \"You naughty children, why did you sleep so long in the wood? we thought you were never coming home again!\" But the father was glad, for it had gone to his heart to leave them both in the wood alone.\n\nNot long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts, and the children heard their mother say at night to their father, \"Everything is finished up; we have only half a loaf, and after that the tale comes to an end. The children must be off; we will take them farther into the wood this time, so that they shall not be able to find the way back again; there is no other way to manage.\" The man felt sad about it, and thought, \"It would better to share one's last morsel with one's children.\" But the wife would listen to nothing that he said, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B too, and when a man has given in once he has to do it a second time.\n\nBut the children were not asleep, and had heard all the talk. When the parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint stones, as he did before, but the wife had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out; but he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Don't cry, Grethel, and go to sleep quietly, and God will help us.\"\n\nEarly the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed. She gave them each a little piece of bread—less than before; and on the way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket, and often stopped to throw a crumb on the ground. \"Hansel, what are you looking at?\" said the father. \"I am looking at my little dove sitting on the roof, to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"You fool,\" said the wife, \"that is no dove, but the sun shining on the chimney pot.\" Hansel went on as before, and strewed bread crumbs all along the road.\n\nThe woman led the children far into the wood, where they had never been before in all their lives. Again they made a large fire, and the mother said, \"Sit still there, you children, and when you are tired you can go to sleep; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening, when we are ready, we will come and fetch you.\"\n\nWhen noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewed his along the road. Then they went to sleep, and the evening passed, and no one came for the poor children. When they awoke it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister, and said, \"Wait a little, Grethel, until the moon gets up, then we shall be able to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along it.\"\n\nWhen the moon got up they set out, but they found no crumbs of bread, for the birds of the woods and of the fields had come and picked them up. Hansel thought they would find the way all the same, but they could not. They went on all night, and the next day from the morning until the evening, but they could not find the way out of the wood, and they were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the few berries they could pick up. And when they were so tired that they could no longer drag themselves along, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep."

      "text": "There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: 'What ails you, dear wife?' 'Ah,' she replied, 'if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.' The man, who loved her, thought: 'Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.' At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. 'How can you dare,' said she with angry look, 'descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!' 'Ah,' answered he, 'let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.' Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: 'If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.' The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:\n\n'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.'\n\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\n\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\n\n'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.'\n\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. 'If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,' said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:\n\n'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.'\n\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up.\n\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: 'He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does'; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: 'I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.' They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: 'Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king's son—he is with me in a moment.' 'Ah! you wicked child,' cried the enchantress. 'What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!' In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.\n\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried:\n\n'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.'\n\nshe let the hair down. The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. 'Aha!' she cried mockingly, 'you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.' The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his lovely wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented."

      "text": "By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller's house was close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter. She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller's boast his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, 'All this must be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.' It was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was locked, and she was left alone.\n\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and said, 'Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping for?' 'Alas!' said she, 'I must spin this straw into gold, and I know not how.' 'What will you give me,' said the manikin, 'to do it for you?' 'My necklace,' replied the maiden. He took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\n\n'Round about, round about,\nLo and behold!\nReel away, reel away,\nStraw into gold!'\n\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and the straw was all spun into gold.\n\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor miller's daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the manikin soon opened the door, and said, 'What will you give me to do your task?' 'The ring on my finger,' said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang:\n\n'Round about, round about,\nLo and behold!\nReel away, reel away,\nStraw into gold!'\n\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\n\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took the miller's daughter to a yet larger heap, and said, 'All this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you shall be my queen.' As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and said, 'What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?' 'I have nothing left,' said she. 'Then say you will give me,' said the little man, 'the first little child that you may have when you are queen.' 'That may never be,' thought the miller's daughter: and as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller's daughter became a queen.\n\nA year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world, and she never gave a thought to the manikin. But suddenly he came into her room, and said, 'Now give me what you promised.' The queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child. But the manikin said, 'No, something alive is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.' Then the queen began to lament and cry, so that the manikin pitied her. 'I will give you three days' grace,' said he, 'if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep your child.'\n\nSo the queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to inquire, far and wide, for any other names that there might be. When the manikin came the next day, she began with Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar, and said all the names she knew, one after another, but to every one the little man said, 'That is not my name.' On the second day she had inquiries made in the neighborhood as to the names of the people there, and she repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious. Perhaps your name is Shortribs, or Sheepshanks, or Laceleg, but he always answered, 'That is not my name.'\n\nOn the third day the messenger came back again, and said, 'I have not been able to find a single new name, but as I came to a high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, there I saw a little house, and before the house a fire was burning, and round about the fire quite a ridiculous little man was jumping, he hopped upon one leg, and shouted -\n\n'To-day I bake, to-morrow brew,\nThe next I'll have the young queen's child.\nHa, glad am I that no one knew\nThat Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.'\n\nYou may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the name. And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, 'Now, mistress queen, what is my name?' at first she said, 'Is your name Conrad?' 'No.' 'Is your name Harry?' 'No.'\n\n'Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?'\n\n'The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that,' cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two."

Close by the king's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The king's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. At this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented someone said to her, \"What ails you, king's daughter? You weep so that even a stone would show pity.\" She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water. \"Ah, old water-splasher, is it you,\" she said, \"I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well. \"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?\" \"Whatever you will have, dear frog,\" said she, \"My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.\" The frog answered, \"I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your little table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise me this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up again.\" \"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring me my ball back again.\" But she thought, \"How the silly frog does talk. All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and croak. He can be no companion to any human being.\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The king's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it. \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog. \"Take me with you. I can't run as you can.\" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could. She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\" She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The king saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what are you so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry you away?\" \"Ah, no,\" replied she. \"It is no giant but a disgusting frog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with you?\" \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water. And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,\n\n\"Princess! youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\nDo you not know what you said to me\nYesterday by the cool waters of the well?\nPrincess, youngest princess!\nOpen the door for me!\"\n\nThen said the king, \"That which you have promised must you perform. Go and let him in.\" She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, \"Lift me up beside you.\" She delayed, until at last the king commanded her to do it. Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push your little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\" She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe king's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. The king grew angry and said, \"He who helped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by you.\" So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner, but when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as you, lift me up or I will tell your father.\" At this she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall. \"Now, will you be quiet, odious frog,\" said she. But when he fell down he was no frog but a king's son with kind and beautiful eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.\n\nThen they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young king's servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young king into his kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the king's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned his head and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\" Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the king's son thought the carriage was breaking, but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy."

      "text": "Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called 'Little Red-Cap.'\n\nOne day her mother said to her: 'Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, \"Good morning\", and don't peep into every corner before you do it.'\n\n'I will take great care,' said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n\n'Good day, Little Red-Cap,' said he.\n\n'Thank you kindly, wolf.'\n\n'Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?'\n\n'To my grandmother's.'\n\n'What have you got in your apron?'\n\n'Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.'\n\n'Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?'\n\n'A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,' replied Little Red-Cap.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself: 'What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful—she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.' So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: 'See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here—why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.'\n\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: 'Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time'; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.\n\n'Who is there?'\n\n'Little Red-Cap,' replied the wolf. 'She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.'\n\n'Lift the latch,' called out the grandmother, 'I am too weak, and cannot get up.'\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: 'Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.' She called out: 'Good morning,' but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n'Oh! grandmother,' she said, 'what big ears you have!'\n\n'The better to hear you with, my child,' was the reply.\n\n'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!' she said.\n\n'The better to see you with, my dear.'\n\n'But, grandmother, what large hands you have!'\n\n'The better to hug you with.'\n\n'Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!'\n\n'The better to eat you with!'\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: 'How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.' So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. 'Do I find you here, you old sinner!' said he. 'I have long sought you!' Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: 'Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf'; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: 'As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.'\n\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said 'good morning' to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. 'Well,' said the grandmother, 'we will shut the door, that he may not come in.' Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: 'Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.' But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: 'Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.' Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again."

      "text": "A long time ago there were a king and queen who said every day, \"Ah, if only we had a child,\" but they never had one. But it happened that once when the queen was bathing, a frog crept out of the water on to the land, and said to her, \"Your wish shall be fulfilled, before a year has gone by, you shall have a daughter.\"\n\nWhat the frog had said came true, and the queen had a little girl who was so pretty that the king could not contain himself for joy, and ordered a great feast. He invited not only his kindred, friends and acquaintances, but also the wise women, in order that they might be kind and well-disposed towards the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but, as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of, one of them had to be left at home.\n\nThe feast was held with all manner of splendor and when it came to an end the wise women bestowed their magic gifts upon the baby - one gave virtue, another beauty, a third riches, and so on with everything in the world that one can wish for.\n\nWhen eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the thirteenth came in. She wished to avenge herself for not having been invited, and without greeting, or even looking at anyone, she cried with a loud voice, \"The king's daughter shall in her fifteenth year prick herself with a spindle, and fall down dead.\" And, without saying a word more, she turned round and left the room.\n\nThey were all shocked, but the twelfth, whose good wish still remained unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo the evil sentence, but only soften it, she said, \"It shall not be death, but a deep sleep of a hundred years, into which the princess shall fall.\"\n\nThe king, who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune, gave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt. Meanwhile the gifts of the wise women were plenteously fulfilled on the young girl, for she was so beautiful, modest, good-natured, and wise, that everyone who saw her was bound to love her.\n\nIt happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and the maiden was left in the palace alone. So she wandered about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower. She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase, and reached a little door. A rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there in a little room sat an old woman with a spindle, busily spinning her flax.\n\n\"Good day, old mother,\" said the king's daughter, \"what are you doing there?\" \"I am spinning,\" said the old woman, and nodded her head. \"What sort of thing is that, that rattles round so merrily?\" said the girl, and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too. But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it.\n\nAnd, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep. And this sleep extended over the whole palace; the king and queen who had just come home, and had entered the great hall, began to go to sleep, and the whole of the court with them. The horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall, even the fire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet and slept, the roast meat left off frizzling, and the cook, who was just going to pull the hair of the scullery boy, because he had forgotten something, let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind fell, and on the trees before the castle not a leaf moved again.\n\nBut round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of thorns, which every year became higher, and at last grew close up round the castle and all over it, so that nothing of it was to be seen, not even the flag upon the roof. But the story of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose, for so the princess was named, went about the country, so that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to get through the thorny hedge into the castle. But they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast together, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught in them, could not get loose again, and died a miserable death.\n\nAfter long, long years a King's son came again to that country, and heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge, and that a castle was said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful princess, called Briar Rose, had been asleep for a hundred years; and that the King and Queen and the whole court were asleep likewise. He had heard, too, from his grandfather, that many kings, sons had already come, and had tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had remained sticking fast in it, and had died a pitiful death.\n\nThen the youth said, \"I am not afraid, I will go and see the beautiful Briar Rose.\" The good old man might dissuade him as he would, he did not listen to his words.\n\nBut by this time the hundred years had just ended, and the day had come when Briar Rose was to awake again. When the King's son came near to the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but large and beautiful flowers, which bent aside of themselves and let him pass unhurt, then they closed again behind him like a hedge. In the castle yard he saw the horses and the spotted hounds lying asleep; on the roof sat the pigeons with their heads under their wings. And when he entered the house, the flies were asleep upon the wall, the cook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize the boy, and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she was going to pluck.\n\nHe went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of the court lying asleep, and up by the throne lay the King and Queen.\n\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath could be heard, and at last he came to the tower, and opened the door into the little room where Briar Rose was sleeping.\n\nThere she lay, so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away; and he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But as soon as he kissed her, Briar Rose opened her eyes and awoke, and looked at him quite sweetly.\n\nThen they went down together, and the King awoke, and the Queen, and the whole court, and looked at each other in great astonishment. And the horses in the courtyard stood up and shook themselves; the hounds jumped up and wagged their tails; the pigeons upon the roof pulled out their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the open country; the flies on the wall crept again; the fire in the kitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat; the joint began to turn and sizzle again, and the cook gave the boy such a box on the ear that he screamed, and the maid finished plucking the fowl.\n\nAnd then the marriage of the King's son with Briar Rose was celebrated with all splendor, and they lived contented to the end of their days."

      "text": "It was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired with her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, \"Peep, peep.\" \"Quack, quack,\" said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. \"How large the world is,\" said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. \"Do you imagine this is the whole world?\" asked the mother; \"Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?\" she continued, rising; \"No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;\" and she seated herself again on the nest.\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on?\" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.\n\n\"One egg is still here, and will not break,\" said the duck, \"but just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see.\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the duck; \"I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; leave it there, and teach the other children to swim.\"\n\n\"I think I will sit on it a little while longer,\" said the mother; \"I have sat so long already, a week more will not hurt me.\"\n\n\"Well, as you please,\" said the old duck, and she went away.\n\nAt last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, \"Peep, peep.\" It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, \"It is very large and not like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to push it myself.\"\n\nOn the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. \"Quack, quack,\" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the mother, \"that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.\"\n\nWhen they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. \"See, children, that is the way of the world,\" said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as the animals and men also know it. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'\"\n\nThe ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, \"Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,\" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is not doing any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so big and ugly,\" said the spiteful duck \"and therefore he must be turned out.\"\n\n\"The others are very pretty children,\" said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, \"all but that one; I wish his mother could smooth him a bit; he is so rough.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, your grace,\" replied the mother; \"he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;\" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, \"It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"The other ducklings are graceful enough,\" said the old duck. \"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"\n\nAnd so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. \"He is too big,\" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, \"Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,\" and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.\n\n\"They are afraid of me because I am ugly,\" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.\n\nIn the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. \"What sort of a duck are you?\" they all said, coming round him.\n\nHe bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. \"You are exceedingly ugly,\" said the wild ducks, \"but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.\"\n\nPoor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. \"Listen, friend,\" said one of them to the duckling, \"you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.\"\n\n\"Pop, pop,\" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. \"Pop, pop,\" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. His eyes glared fearfully, he thrust his tongue out of his mouth, and his teeth gleamed. He splashed into the water, and swam towards the duckling, but the poor creature was so frightened that he did not think of flying, but tried to hide himself under the water. The dog, however, turned away, and swam back to the shore without touching him.\n\n\"Oh,\" sighed the duckling, \"how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me.\" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, \"My little son,\" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs, so she was called \"Chickie short legs.\" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.\n\n\"What is that noise?\" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. \"Oh what a prize!\" she exclaimed, \"I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I must wait and see.\" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, \"We and the world,\" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. \"Can you lay eggs?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue.\" \"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?\" said the tom cat. \"No.\" \"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.\" So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.\n\n\"What an absurd idea,\" said the hen. \"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.\"\n\n\"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,\" said the duckling, \"and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive under the water.\"\n\n\"Delightful, indeed!\" said the hen, \"why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman; there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something? But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I believe I must go out into the world again,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, \"Croak, croak.\" It made one shiver with cold to look at him. The poor duckling had much to suffer during the hard winter. However, when the sun began to shine again warmly, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, where apple trees were in full blossom, where the lilacs sent forth their fragrance, and hung their long green branches down to the winding canal. Oh! here it was beautiful, fresh and springlike! and from out the thicket came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.\n\n\"I will fly to those royal birds,\" he exclaimed, \"and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.\"\n\nThen he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.\n\n\"Kill me,\" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.\n\nBut what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.\n\nInto the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.\n\n\"See,\" cried the youngest, \"there is a new one;\" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, \"There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.\"\n\nThen they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, \"The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.\" And the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, \"I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.\""

      "text": "Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King and his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most singular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and small, glide between the branches, as birds fly among the trees here upon land. In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells, that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would be fit for the diadem of a queen.\n\nThe Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his aged mother kept house for him. She was a very wise woman, and exceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account she wore twelve oysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were only allowed to wear six. She was, however, deserving of very great praise, especially for her care of the little sea-princesses, her grand-daughters. They were six beautiful children; but the youngest was the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like all the others, she had no feet, and her body ended in a fish's tail. All day long they played in the great halls of the castle, or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls. The large amber windows were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows, excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves to be stroked. The Sea King had a large garden, in which grew flowers of all colors, and fruits that shone like gold, and flowers that glowed like burning fire. The whole sky looked like gold, and the sea was violet and blue, with flowers and fruits shining like stars. The little princesses had their own gardens, where they could dig and plant as they pleased. One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale; another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid; but that of the youngest was round like the sun, and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset. She was a strange child, quiet and thoughtful; and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble statue. It was the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure white stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck. She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow. It grew splendidly, and soon hung its fresh branches over the statue, towards the blue sandy ground, where the shadows showed violet. It was delightful to watch the branches swaying, as if they were playing a game with their shadows on the smooth sandy bottom."

      "text": "THE SNOW QUEEN.\n\nA TALE IN SEVEN STORIES\n\nFIRST STORY\n\nWHICH DEALS WITH A MIRROR AND ITS FRAGMENTS\n\nNow we are about to begin, and you must attend; and when we get to the\nend of the story, you will know more than you do now about a very wicked\nhobgoblin. He was one of the worst kind; in fact he was a real demon.\nOne day he was in a high state of delight because he had invented a\nmirror with this peculiarity, that every good and pretty thing reflected\nin it shrank away to almost nothing. On the other hand, every bad and\ngood-for-nothing thing stood out and looked its worst. The most\nbeautiful landscapes reflected in it looked like boiled spinach, and the\nbest people became hideous, or else they were upside down and had no\nbodies. Their faces were distorted beyond recognition, and if they had\neven one freckle it appeared to spread all over the nose and mouth. The\ndemon thought this immensely amusing. If a good thought passed through\nany one's mind, it turned to a grin in the mirror, and this caused real\ndelight to the demon. All the scholars in the demon's school, for he\nkept a school, reported that a miracle had taken place: now for the\nfirst time it had become possible to see what the world and mankind were\nreally like. They ran about all over with the mirror, till at last there\nwas not a country or a person which had not been seen in this distorting\nmirror. They even wanted to fly up to heaven with it to mock the angels;\nbut the higher they flew, the more it grinned, so much so that they\ncould hardly hold it, and at last it slipped out of their hands and fell\nto the earth, shivered into hundreds of millions and billions of bits.\nEven then it did more harm than ever. Some of these bits were not as big\nas a grain of sand, and these flew about all over the world, getting\ninto people's eyes, and, once in, they stuck there, and distorted\neverything they looked at, or made them see everything that was amiss.\nEach tiniest grain of glass kept the same power as that possessed by the\nwhole mirror. Some people even got a bit of the glass into their hearts,\nand that was terrible, for the heart became like a lump of ice. Some of\nthe fragments were so big that they were used for window panes, but it\nwas not advisable to look at one's friends through these panes. Other\nbits were made into spectacles, and it was a bad business when people\nput on these spectacles meaning to be just. The bad demon laughed\ntill he split his sides; it tickled him to see the mischief he had done.\nBut some of these fragments were still left floating about the world,\nand you shall hear what happened to them.\n\nSECOND STORY\n\nABOUT A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL\n\nIn a big town crowded with houses and people, where there is no room for\ngardens, people have to be content with flowers in pots instead. In one\nof these towns lived two children who managed to have something bigger\nthan a flower pot for a garden. They were not brother and sister, but\nthey were just as fond of each other as if they had been. Their parents\nlived opposite each other in two attic rooms. The roof of one house just\ntouched the roof of the next one, with only a rain-water gutter between\nthem. They each had a little dormer window, and one only had to step\nover the gutter to get from one house to the other. Each of the parents\nhad a large window-box, in which they grew pot herbs and a little\nrose-tree. There was one in each box, and they both grew splendidly.\nThen it occurred to the parents to put the boxes across the gutter, from\nhouse to house, and they looked just like two banks of flowers. The pea\nvines hung down over the edges of the boxes, and the roses threw out\nlong creepers which twined round the windows. It was almost like a green\ntriumphal arch. The boxes were high, and the children knew they must not\nclimb up on to them, but they were often allowed to have their little\nstools out under the rose-trees, and there they had delightful games. Of\ncourse in the winter there was an end to these amusements. The windows\nwere often covered with hoar-frost; then they would warm coppers on the\nstove and stick them on the frozen panes, where they made lovely\npeep-holes, as round as possible. Then a bright eye would peep through\nthese holes, one from each window. The little boy's name was Kay, and\nthe little girl's Gerda.\n\nIn the summer they could reach each other with one bound, but in the\nwinter they had to go down all the stairs in one house and up all the\nstairs in the other, and outside there were snow-drifts.\n\n'Look! the white bees are swarming,' said the old grandmother.\n\n'Have they a queen bee, too?' asked the little boy, for he knew that\nthere was a queen among the real bees.\n\n'Yes, indeed they have,' said the grandmother. 'She flies where the\nswarm is thickest. She is biggest of them all, and she never remains on\nthe ground. She always flies up again to the sky. Many a winter's night\nshe flies through the streets and peeps in at the windows, and then the\nice freezes on the panes into wonderful patterns like flowers.'\n\n'Oh yes, we have seen that,' said both children, and then they knew\nit was true.\n\n'Can the Snow Queen come in here?' asked the little girl.\n\n'Just let her come,' said the boy, 'and I will put her on the stove,\nwhere she will melt.'\n\nBut the grandmother smoothed his hair and told him more stories.\n\nIn the evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed, he crept\nup on to the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little hole. A\nfew snow-flakes were falling, and one of these, the biggest, remained on\nthe edge of the window-box. It grew bigger and bigger, till it became\nthe figure of a woman, dressed in the finest white gauze, which appeared\nto be made of millions of starry flakes. She was delicately lovely, but\nall ice, glittering, dazzling ice. Still she was alive, her eyes shone\nlike two bright stars, but there was no rest or peace in them. She\nnodded to the window and waved her hand. The little boy was frightened and jumped down off the chair, and then he fancied that a big bird flew\npast the window.\n\nThe next day was bright and frosty, and then came the thaw—and after\nthat the spring. The sun shone, green buds began to appear, the swallows\nbuilt their nests, and people began to open their windows. The little\nchildren began to play in their garden on the roof again. The roses were\nin splendid bloom that summer; the little girl had learnt a hymn, and\nthere was something in it about roses, and that made her think of her\nown. She sang it to the little boy, and then he sang it with her—\n\n'Where roses deck the flowery vale,\n\nThere, Infant Jesus, we thee hail!'\n\nThe children took each other by the hands, kissed the roses, and\nrejoiced in God's bright sunshine, and spoke to it as if the Child Jesus\nwere there. What lovely summer days they were, and how delightful it was\nto sit out under the fresh rose-trees, which seemed never tired of\nblooming.\n\nKay and Gerda were looking at a picture book of birds and animals one\nday—it had just struck five by the church clock—when Kay said, 'Oh,\nsomething struck my heart, and I have got something in my eye!'\n\nThe little girl put her arms round his neck, he blinked his eye; there\nwas nothing to be seen.\n\n'I believe it is gone,' he said; but it was not gone. It was one of\nthose very grains of glass from the mirror, the magic mirror. You\nremember that horrid mirror, in which all good and great things\nreflected in it became small and mean, while the bad things were\nmagnified, and every flaw became very apparent.\n\nPoor Kay! a grain of it had gone straight to his heart, andwould soon\nturn it to a lump of ice. He did not feel it any more, but it was still\nthere.\n\n'Why do you cry?' he asked; 'it makes you look ugly; there's nothing the\nmatter with me. How horrid!' he suddenly cried; 'there's a worm in that\nrose, and that one is quite crooked; after all, they are nasty roses,\nand so are the boxes they are growing in!' He kicked the box and broke\noff two of the roses.\n\n'What are you doing, Kay?' cried the little girl. When he saw her alarm,\nhe broke off another rose, and then ran in by his own window, and left\ndear little Gerda alone.\n\nWhen she next got out the picture book he said it was only fit for\nbabies in long clothes. When his grandmother told them stories he always\nhad a but—, and if he could manage it, he liked to get behind her\nchair, put on her spectacles and imitate her. He did it very well and\npeople laughed at him. He was soon able to imitate every one in the\nstreet; he could make fun of all their peculiarities and failings. 'He\nwill turn out a clever fellow,' said people. But it was all that bit of\nglass in his heart, that bit of glass in his eye, and it made him tease\nlittle Gerda who was so devoted to him. He played quite different games\nnow; he seemed to have grown older. One winter's day, when the snow was\nfalling fast, he brought in a big magnifying glass; he held out the tail\nof his blue coat, and let the snow flakes fall upon it.\n\n'Now look through the glass, Gerda!' he said; every snowflake was\nmagnified, and looked like a lovely flower, or a sharply pointed star.\n\n'Do you see how cleverly they are made?' said Kay. 'Much more\ninteresting than looking at real flowers. And there is not a single flaw\nin them; they are perfect, if only they would not melt.'\n\nShortly after, he appeared in his thick gloves, with his sledge on his\nback. He shouted right into Gerda's ear, 'I have got leave to drive in\nthe big square where the other boys play!' and away he went.\n\nIn the big square the bolder boys used to tie their little sledges to\nthe farm carts and go a long way in this fashion. They had no end of fun\nover it. Just in the middle of their games a big sledge came along; it\nwas painted white, and the occupant wore a white fur coat and cap. The\nsledge drove twice round the square, and Kay quickly tied his sledge on\nbehind. Then off they went, faster, and faster, into the next street.\nThe driver turned round and nodded to Kay in the most friendly way, just\nas if they knew each other. Every time Kay wanted to loose his sledge\nthe person nodded again, and Kay stayed where he was, and they drove\nright out through the town gates. Then the snow began to fall so heavily\nthat the little boy could not see a hand before him as they rushed\nalong. He undid the cords and tried to get away from the big sledge, but\nit was no use, his little sledge stuck fast, and on they rushed, faster\nthan the wind. He shouted aloud, but nobody heard him, and the sledge\ntore on through the snow-drifts. Every now and then it gave a bound, as\nif they were jumping over hedges and ditches. He was very frightened,\nand he wanted to say his prayers, but he could only remember the\nmultiplication tables.\n\nThe snow-flakes grew bigger and bigger, till at last they looked like\nbig white chickens. All at once they sprang on one side, the big sledge\nstopped and the person who drove got up, coat and cap smothered in snow.\nIt was a tall and upright lady all shining white, the Snow Queen\nherself.\n\n'We have come along at a good pace,' she said; 'but it's cold enough to\nkill one; creep inside my bearskin coat.'\n\nShe took him into the sledge by her, wrapped him in her furs, and he\nfelt as if he were sinking into a snowdrift.\n\n'Are you still cold?' she asked, and she kissed him on the forehead.\nUgh! it was colder than ice, it went to his very heart, which was\nalready more than half ice; he felt as if he were dying, but only for a\nmoment, and then it seemed to have done him good; he no longer felt the\ncold.\n\n'My sledge! don't forget my sledge!' He only remembered it now; it was\ntied to one of the white chickens which flew along behind them. The Snow\nQueen kissed Kay again, and then he forgot all about little Gerda,\nGrandmother, and all the others at home.\n\n'Now I mustn't kiss you any more,' she said, 'or I should kiss you to\ndeath!'\n\nKay looked at her, she was so pretty; a cleverer, more beautiful face\ncould hardly be imagined. She did not seem to be made of ice now, as she"

      "text": "THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES\n\nMany years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of\nnew clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble\nhimself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either\nto the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded\nhim for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each\nhour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed\nto say, “he is sitting in council,” it was always said of him, “The\nEmperor is sitting in his wardrobe.”\n\nTime passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers\narrived every day at the court. One day came two rogues, calling\nthemselves weavers, and they said that they knew how to weave stuffs of\nthe most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes\nmanufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining\ninvisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was\nextraordinarily simple in character.\n\n“These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!” thought the Emperor. “Had I\nsuch a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit\nfor their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the\nfoolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately.” And he caused\nlarge sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they\nmight begin their work directly.\n\nSo the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work\nvery busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for\nthe most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their\nown knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty\nlooms until late at night.\n\n“I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,”\nsaid the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was,\nhowever, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or\none unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be\nsure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he\nwould prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the\nweavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All\nthe people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the\ncloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how\nignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.\n\n“I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,” said the\nEmperor at last, after some deliberation, “he will be best able to see\nhow the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more\nsuitable for his office than he is.”\n\nSo the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were\nworking with all their might, at their empty looms. “What can be the\nmeaning of this?” thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. “I\ncannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.” However, he did\nnot express his thoughts aloud.\n\nThe impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come\nnearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him,\nand whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time\npointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked,\nhe could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason,\nviz: there was nothing there. “What!” thought he again. “Is it possible\nthat I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must\nknow it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No,\nthat must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see\nthe stuff.”\n\n“Well, Sir Minister!” said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.\n“What do you think of this?”\n\n“Oh! it is excellent!” replied the old minister, looking at the loom\nthrough his spectacles. “This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell\nthe Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.”\n\n“We shall be much obliged to you,” said the impostors, and then they\nnamed the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended\nstuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order\nthat he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for\nmore silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they\nhad begun. However, they put all that was given them into their\nknapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as\nbefore at their empty looms.\n\nThe Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men\nwere getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be\nready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister;\nhe surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but\nthe empty frames.\n\n“Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord\nthe minister?” asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador;\nat the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the\ndesign and colors which were not there.\n\n“I certainly am not stupid!” thought the messenger. “It must be, that I\nam not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however,\nno one shall know anything about it.” And accordingly he praised the\nstuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both\ncolors and patterns. “Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,” said he to\nhis sovereign when he returned, “the cloth which the weavers are\npreparing is extraordinarily magnificent.”\n\nThe whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had\nordered to be woven at his own expense.\n\nAnd now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture,\nwhile it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of\nofficers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had\nalready admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as\nsoon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more\ndiligently than ever; although they still did not pass a single thread\nthrough the looms.\n\n“Is not the work absolutely magnificent?” said the two officers of the\ncrown, already mentioned. “If your Majesty will only be pleased to look\nat it! what a splendid design! what magnificent colors!” and at the same\ntime they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone\nelse could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.\n\n“How is this?” said the Emperor to himself. “I can see nothing at all.\nThis is indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be\nan Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen—Oh! the\ncloth is charming,” said he, aloud. “It has my complete approbation.”\nAnd he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms;\nfor on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the\nofficers who had the care of his wardrobe had praised so much. All his\nretinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the\nlooms, but they could see no more than the others; nevertheless, they\nall exclaimed, “Oh, how beautiful!” and advised his majesty to have\nsome new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching\nprocession. “Magnificent! Charming! Excellent!” resounded on all sides;\nand everyone was uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general\nsatisfaction; and presented the impostors with the riband of an order\nof knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and the title of\n“Gentlemen Weavers.”\n\nThe rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the\nprocession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that\neveryone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new\nsuit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with\ntheir scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.\n“See,” cried they, at last. “The Emperor's new clothes are ready!”\n\nAnd now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the\nweavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding\nsomething up, saying, “Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the\nscarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one\nmight fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that,\nhowever, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.”\n\n“Yes indeed!” said all the courtiers, although not one of them could\nsee anything of this exquisite manufacture.\n\n“If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your\nclothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.”\n\nThe Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to\narray him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to\nside, before the looking glass.\n\n“How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they\nfit!” everyone cried out. “What a design! What colors! These are indeed\nroyal robes!”\n\n“The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession,\nis waiting,” announced the chief master of the ceremonies.\n\n“I am quite ready,” answered the Emperor. “Do my new clothes fit well?”\nasked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in\norder that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.\n\nThe lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt\nabout on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle;\nand pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means\nbetray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.\n\nSo now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the\nprocession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people\nstanding by, and those at the windows, cried out, “Oh! How beautiful\nare our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to the\nmantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!” in short, no one would\nallow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in\ndoing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit\nfor his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had\never made so great an impression, as these invisible ones.\n\n“But the Emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.\n\n“Listen to the voice of innocence!” exclaimed his father; and what the\nchild had said was whispered from one to another.\n\n“But he has nothing on at all,” cried at last the whole people. That\nmade a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they\nwere right; but he thought to himself, “Now I must bear up to the end.”\nAnd the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity, as if they\ncarried a train which did not exist."

He travelled right round the world to find one, but there was always something wrong. There were plenty of princesses, but whether they were real princesses he had great difficulty in discovering; there was always something which was not quite right about them. So at last he had to come home again, and he was very sad because he wanted a real princess so badly.\n\nOne evening there was a terrible storm; it thundered and lightened and the rain poured down in torrents; indeed it was a fearful night.\n\nIn the middle of the storm somebody knocked at the town gate, and the old King himself went to open it.\n\nIt was a princess who stood outside, but she was in a terrible state from the rain and the storm. The water streamed out of her hair and her clothes; it ran in at the top of her shoes and out at the heel, but she said that she was a real princess.\n\n‘Well we shall soon see if that is true,’ thought the old Queen, but she said nothing. She went into the bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off and laid a pea on the bed; then she took twenty mattresses and piled them on top of the pea, and then twenty feather beds on top of the mattresses. This was where the princess was to sleep that night. In the morning they asked her how she had slept.\n\n‘Oh terribly bad!’ said the princess. ‘I have hardly closed my eyes the whole night! Heaven knows what was in the bed. I seemed to be lying upon some hard thing, and my whole body is black and blue this morning. It is terrible!’\n\nThey saw at once that she must be a real princess when she had felt the pea through twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds.

      "text": "LITTLE THUMBELINA\n\nHERE was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child. She went to a fairy and said: “I should so very much like to have a little child. Can you tell me where I can find one?”\n\n“Oh, that can be easily managed,” said the fairy. “Here is a barleycorn; it is not exactly of the same sort as those which grow in the farmers' fields, and which the chickens eat. Put it into a flower-pot and see what will happen.”\n\n“Thank you,” said the woman; and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted it, and there grew up a large, handsome flower, somewhat like a tulip, but the leaves were tightly closed, as if it were still a bud.\n\n“It is a beautiful flower,” said the woman, and she kissed its red and golden leaves; but as she kissed it the flower opened. It was a real tulip, such as one can see; but in the midst of the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was scarcely half so long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of Little Thumb, or Thumbelina, because she was so small.\n\nA walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet leaves, with a rose leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plate full of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip leaf, which served the little one for a boat. Here she sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horsehair. It was a very pretty sight. Thumbelina could also sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard.\n\nOne night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane of glass in the window and leaped right up on the table where she lay sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt.\n\n“What a pretty little wife this would make for my son!” said the toad, and she took up the walnut-shell in which Thumbelina lay asleep, and jumped through the window with it, into the garden.\n\nIn the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived the toad with her son. He was uglier even than his mother; and when he saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could only cry “Croak, croak, croak.”\n\n“Don't speak so loud, or she will wake,” said the toad, “and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan's-down. We will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and small, and then she can't escape; and we will set the room in order down in the marsh, where you are to live and keep house together.”\n\nFar out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with broad green leaves which seemed to float on the top of the water. The largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest, and the old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which Thumbelina lay still asleep.\n\nThe tiny creature woke very early in the morning and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.\n\nMeanwhile the old toad was very busy down in the marsh, decking her room with rushes and wild yellow flowers, to make it look pretty for her new daughter-in-law. Then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed poor Thumbelina. She wanted to bring the pretty bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be ready for her. The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said, “Here is my son; he will be your husband, and you will live happily together in the marsh by the stream.”\n\n“Croak, croak, croak,” was all her son could say for himself. So the toads took up the elegant little bed and swam away with it, leaving Thumbelina all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept. She could not bear to think of living with the old toad and having her ugly son for a husband. The little fishes who swam about in the water beneath had seen the toad and heard what she said, so they lifted their heads above the water to look at the little maiden. As soon as they caught sight of her they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.\n\n“No, it must never be!” So they gathered together in the water, round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their teeth. Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Thumbelina far away out of reach of land.\n\nThumbelina sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the bushes saw her and sang, “What a lovely little creature.” So the leaf swam away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to other lands. A graceful little white butterfly constantly fluttered round her and at last alighted on the leaf. He had taken a fancy to Thumbelina, and her too, because she was so delighted that the toad could not reach her now, and the country through which she sailed was so beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water till it glittered like shining gold. She took off her girdle and tied one end of it round the butterfly, fastening the other end of the ribbon to the leaf, which now glided on much faster than before, taking Thumbelina with it.\n\nPresently a large cockchafer flew by. The moment he caught sight of her he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws and flew with her into a tree. The green leaf floated away on the brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he was fastened to it and could not get away.\n\nOh, how frightened poor little Thumbelina felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree! But especially was she sorry for the pretty white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he could not free himself he would die of hunger. But the cockchafer did not trouble himself at all about the matter. He seated himself by her side on a large green leaf, gave her some honey from the flowers to eat, and told her she was very pretty, though not in the least like a cockchafer. After a time all the cockchafers who lived in the tree came to pay Thumbelina a visit.\n\n“Look, she has only two legs! How ugly that looks!” said the cockchafers.\n\n“She has no feelers,” said another.\n\n“Her waist is quite slim. Pooh! She is like a human being,” said the lady cockchafers.\n\n“How ugly she is!” said all the lady cockchafers.\n\nYet Thumbelina was as pretty as any girl could be, and the cockchafer who had run away with her knew it, for he had fallen in love with her the moment he saw her. But when the others said she was ugly, he at last came to think so, too, and would have nothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where she liked. Then he flew down with her from the tree and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her. And all the while she was really the loveliest creature that anyone could imagine, and as tender and delicate as a beautiful rose leaf.\n\nAll the summer through poor Thumbelina lived quite alone in the vast forest. She wove herself a bed with blades of grass and hung it up under a broad leaf to protect herself from the rain. She sucked honey from the flowers for food and drank the dew from their leaves every morning. So passed away the summer and the autumn, and then came the winter — the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung to her so sweetly had flown away, and the trees and the flowers had withered. The large shamrock under the shelter of which she had lived was now rolled together and shrivelled up; nothing remained but a yellow withered stalk. She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate that she was nearly frozen to death. It began to snow, too; and the snowflakes, as they fell upon her, were like a whole shovelful falling upon one of us, for we are tall, but she was only an inch high. Then she wrapped herself in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold.\n\nNear the wood in which she had been living was a large corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time; nothing remained but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the frozen ground. It was to her like struggling through a large wood. Oh! how she shivered with the cold. She came at last to the door of a field mouse, who had a little den under the corn stubble. There dwelt the field mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining-room. Poor Thumbelina stood before the door, just like a little beggar girl, and begged for a small piece of barleycorn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days.\n\n“You poor little creature,” said the field mouse, for she was really a good old mouse, “come into my warm room and dine with me.” She was pleased with Thumbelina, so she said, “You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I am very fond of hearing them.” And Thumbelina did all the field mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.\n\n“We shall have a visitor soon,” said the field mouse one day; “my neighbor pays me a visit once a week. He is better off than I am; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet suit. If only you could have him for a husband, you would be well provided for indeed. But he is blind, so you must tell him some of your prettiest stories.”\n\nBut Thumbelina did not care about this; she did not want to marry the neighbor, for he was a mole. He came and paid his visit in his black velvet suit. He was very rich and learned, and the field mouse said that his house was twenty times larger than hers, and that he had great knowledge, but he did not like the sun and the pretty flowers, for he had never seen them. Thumbelina had to sing to him, so she sang “Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home,” and other songs. And the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for he was very prudent.\n\nA short time before, the mole had dug a long passage under the earth from his own house to theirs, and gave the field mouse and Thumbelina permission to walk in it as much as they wished. But he told them not to be afraid of the dead bird which lay in the passage. It was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have been dead long, and was lying just where the mole had made his passage. The mole took in his mouth a piece of phosphorescent wood, which glittered like fire in the dark, and then he went before them to light them through the long, dark passage. When they came to the spot where the dead bird lay, the mole pushed up the earth with his broad nose and made an opening, through which the daylight shone. In the middle of the floor lay a swallow, with his beautiful wings folded at his sides and his head and legs drawn back under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold. It made Thumbelina very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds, which had sung and twittered for her so beautifully all the summer, but the mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs and said, “He will sing no more now. How miserable it must be to be born a little bird! I am thankful that none of my children will ever be birds, for they can do nothing but sing ‘tweet, tweet,’ and always die of hunger in the winter.”\n\n“Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!” exclaimed the field mouse. “What has a bird when winter comes? He must starve and freeze. But they are very high bred, I suppose.”\n\nThumbelina said nothing, but when the two others had turned their backs upon the bird, she stooped down and stroked the soft feathers which covered his head, and kissed the closed eyelids.\n\n“Perhaps this was one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer,” she thought. “How much pleasure you gave me, dear, pretty bird.”\n\nThe mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone, and then went home with the ladies. But that night Thumbelina could not sleep; so she got out of bed and wove a large, beautiful carpet of hay. She carried it to the dead bird and spread it over him, with some soft wool from the flowers which she had found in the field mouse's room. It was as soft as wool on one side, and she placed some under the bird's head and body, so that he might lie warmly in the cold earth.\n\n“Good-bye, pretty little bird,” said she, “good-bye. Thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when all the trees were green and the warm sun shone upon us.” Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went “thump, thump.” It was the bird's heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth had restored him to life. In autumn all the swallows fly away to warm countries; but if one happens to linger, the cold seizes it; it becomes chilled and falls down as if dead; it remains where it fell, and the cold snow covers it.\n\nThumbelina trembled very much, she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, very large, compared with her, who was only an inch high. But she took courage, laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and brought a leaf which she had used as a counterpane and laid it over his head.\n\nThe next night she once more stole out to him, and found he had come to life, though he could scarcely open his eyes to look at her, for he was very weak. He could only look at her for a moment, and then he closed them again.\n\n“Good-night, pretty little bird,” said Thumbelina. “Thank you for singing so sweetly to me during the summer.” And she laid her head on his breast.\n\nThe swallow thanked her for her kindness, and told her how he had injured his wing in a thorn-bush and could not fly as fast as the others, who were soon far away on their journey to warm countries. Then he had fallen to the earth and could remember no more, nor how he came to be where she had found him.\n\nThe whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Thumbelina nursed him with care and love. She did not tell either the mole or the field mouse anything about it, for they did not like swallows. Very soon the spring came, and the sun warmed the earth. Then the swallow said good-bye to Thumbelina, and she opened the hole in the ceiling which the mole had made. The sun shone in upon them so deliciously that the swallow asked her if she would go with him. She could sit on his back, he said, and he would fly away with her into the green woods. But Thumbelina knew it would grieve the field mouse if she left her in that manner, so she said, “No, I cannot.”\n\n“Farewell, then, farewell, kind, good maiden,” said the swallow, and he flew out into the sunshine.\n\nThumbelina looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes. She was very fond of the poor swallow.\n\n“Tweet, tweet,” sang the bird as he flew out into the wood.\n\nThumbelina was very sad. She was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sown in the field over the house of the field mouse grew high into the air, and formed a thick wood to Thumbelina, who was only an inch in height.\n\n“You are going to be married, little one,” said the field mouse. “My neighbor has asked for you. What good fortune for a poor child like you! Now we will prepare your wedding clothes. They must be woollen and linen. Nothing must be wanting when you are the wife of the mole.”\n\nThumbelina had to turn the spindle, and the field mouse hired four spiders, who were to weave day and night. Every evening the mole visited her and was continually speaking of the time when the summer would be over. Then he would keep his wedding day with Thumbelina; but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth and made it hard, like stone. As soon as the summer was over the wedding should take place; but Thumbelina was not at all pleased, for she did not like the tiresome mole. Every morning when the sun rose and every evening when it went down she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew the corn apart so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there and wished so much to see her dear friend, the swallow, again. But he never returned, for by this time he had flown far away into the lovely green forest.\n\nWhen autumn arrived Thumbelina had her outfit ready.\n\n“In four weeks the wedding must take place,” said the field mouse. But Thumbelina wept and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.\n\n“Nonsense,” replied the field mouse. “Now don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth. He is a very handsome mole; the queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets and furs. His kitchen and cellars are quite full. You ought to be very thankful for such good fortune.”\n\nSo the wedding day was fixed, on which the mole was to take Thumbelina away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never again to see the warm sun, because he did not like it. The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.\n\n“Farewell, bright sun,” she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house, for the corn had been reaped, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields. “Farewell, farewell,” she repeated, twining her arm around a little red flower that grew just by her side. “Greet the little swallow from me, if you should see him again.”\n\n“Tweet, tweet,” sounded over her head suddenly. She looked up, and there was the swallow just passing. He was so delighted to see Thumbelina. She told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, nevermore to see the bright sun. And as she told him, she wept.\n\n“Cold winter is coming,” said the swallow. “I am going to fly away into warmer countries. Will you go with me? You can sit on my back and fasten yourself on with your sash. Then we can fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms — far away, over the mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more brightly than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers bloom in the greatest beauty. Fly now with me, dear little Thumbelina; you saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark, dreary passage.”\n\n“Yes, I will go with you,” said Thumbelina; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers.\n\nThe swallow rose in the air and flew over forest and over sea — high above the highest mountains, covered with eternal snow. Thumbelina would have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept under the bird's warm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered, so that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they passed. At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly and the sky seems so much higher above the earth. Here on the hedges and by the wayside grew purple, green, and white grapes; lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods; and the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful children ran along the country lanes, playing with gay butterflies. And as the swallow flew farther and farther, every place appeared still more lovely.\n\nAt last they came to a blue lake, and by the side of it, shaded by trees of the deepest green, stood a palace of dazzling white marble, built in the olden times. Vines clustered round its lofty pillars, and at the top were many swallows' nests, and one of these was the home of the swallow who carried Thumbelina.\n\n“This is my house,” said the swallow; “but it would not do for you to live there; you would not be comfortable. You must choose for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you happy.”\n\n“That will be delightful,” she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.\n\nA large marble pillar lay on the ground, which in falling had been broken into three pieces. Between these pieces grew the most beautiful large white flowers; so the swallow flew down with Thumbelina and placed her on one of the broad leaves. But how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower a tiny little man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal! He had a gold crown on his head, and delicate wings at his shoulders, and was not much larger than was Thumbelina herself. He was the angel of the flower, for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower, and this was the king of them all.\n\n“Oh, how beautiful he is!” whispered Thumbelina to the swallow.\n\nThe little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, which was like a giant compared to such a delicate little creature as he; but when he saw Thumbelina he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen. He took the gold crown from his head and placed it on hers, and asked her name, and if she would be his wife and queen over all the flowers.\n\nThis certainly was a very different sort of husband from the son of the toad, or the mole with his black velvet and fur; so she said yes to the handsome prince. Then all the flowers opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them. Each of them brought Thumbelina a present; but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged to a large white fly, and they fastened them to Thumbelina's shoulders, so that she might fly from flower to flower.\n\nThen there was much rejoicing, and the little swallow, who sat above them in his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad, for he was very fond of Thumbelina and would have liked never to part from her again.\n\n“You must not be called Thumbelina any more,” said the spirit of the flowers to her. “It is an ugly name, and you are so very lovely. We will call you Maia.”\n\n“Good-bye, good-bye,” said the swallow, with a heavy heart, as he left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark. There he had a nest over the window of a house in which dwelt a man who could tell fairy tales. The swallow sang “Tweet, tweet,” and from his song came the whole story."

      "text": "THE STEADFAST TIN SOLDIER\n\nTHERE were once twenty-five tin soldiers. They were all brothers, born of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered their muskets and looked straight ahead of them, splendid in their uniforms, all red and blue.\n\nThe very first thing in the world that they heard was, “Tin soldiers!” A small boy shouted it and clapped his hands. The soldiers had been given to him for a birthday present, and now he was putting them out upon the table.\n\nAll the soldiers looked exactly alike except one. He looked a little different as he had been cast last of all. The tin was short, so he had only one leg. But there he stood, as steady on one leg as the others on two, and he is the soldier that became famous.\n\nOn the table with the soldiers were many other playthings, and one that no eye could tire of looking at was a marvelous castle of cardboard. Through the tiny windows you could see into the halls. In front of the castle stood miniature trees around a little mirror supposed to represent a lake, and in it swam and reflected wax swans.\n\nThe castle was delightful. But most delightful of all was a little lady standing in the open doorway. She was cut out of paper too, but she had a dress of stiffest tulle. A narrow blue ribbon ran over her shoulder and down like a scarf, and on this was fastened a spangle as big as her face.\n\nThe little lady held out both her arms, for she was a dancer, and she lifted one leg so high in the air that the tin soldier couldn't find it at all, and thought she must have only one leg, like himself.\n\n“That would be a wife for me,” he thought. “But maybe she's too grand. She lives in a castle. I have only a box, and there are twenty-five of us in that. It is no place for her! But I must try to make her acquaintance.” And so he lay down at full length behind a snuffbox on the table; from there he could watch the dainty little lady, who kept standing on one leg without losing her balance.\n\nWhen the evening came, all the other tin soldiers went into their box, and the people of the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play at visiting, and at war, and a ball. The tin soldiers rattled about in their box, for they wanted to play too, but could not get the lid open. The nutcracker turned somersaults, and the slate pencil squeaked out jokes on the slate. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to whistle to them, not in the usual way but in verse. The only two who stayed still were the tin soldier and the little dancer. She remained upright on her toes, with both arms outstretched; he stood steadfastly on his one leg, never taking his eyes off her for a moment.\n\nNow it struck twelve, and crack!—up popped the lid of the snuffbox; but there was no snuff inside, only a little black imp—that's the beauty of it.\n\n“Tin soldier!” said the imp. “Don't stare like that!” But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.\n\n“All right, you wait till tomorrow!” said the imp.\n\nWhen it was morning, and the children were up, the tin soldier was put on the window ledge. Suddenly—whether it was the imp or a gust of wind I don't know, but all at once the window flew open, and the soldier fell head over heels from the third story—right down, whirling as he went round, and he landed at last in the street with his cap and bayonet between the paving stones.\n\nThe boy and the maid came running to look for him, but though they were so near him they nearly trod on him, they did not manage to find him. If the tin soldier had called “Here I am!” they would easily have found him, but he thought it contemptible to raise an alarm when he was wearing a uniform.\n\nNow it began to drizzle. Soon the drops fell faster, and there came a pouring shower. When it was over, two street boys came along.\n\n“Look!” said one. “There's a tin soldier! Let's send him sailing!”\n\nSo they made a boat of newspaper, put the tin soldier in it, and away he went down the gutter with the two street boys running beside him and clapping their hands. What waves there were in the gutter, and how fast the current swept along. The paper boat tossed up and down, and whirled about so quickly that the soldier became quite dizzy. But he remained steadfast, gave no glance away, looked straight in front of him, shoulder-arms. Suddenly the boat rushed in under a long culvert; it became as dark as the soldier's box.\n\n“Where can I be going?” he thought. “This must be that imp's revenge. Ah! if only the little lady was sitting beside me in the boat, it might be twice as dark for all I would care.”\n\nSuddenly there came along a large water rat that lived under the culvert.\n\n“Have you a passport?” said the rat. “Out with your passport!”\n\nBut the tin soldier was silent, and gripped his gun more firmly.\n\nThe boat sped on, and the rat behind it. Ugh! how he showed his teeth, as he cried to the bits of straw and wood: “Hold him, hold him! he has not paid the toll. He has not shown his passport!”\n\nBut the current became swifter and swifter. The tin soldier could already see daylight where the tunnel ended, but in his ears there sounded a roaring enough to frighten any brave man. Only think! at the end of the tunnel the gutter flowed straight into a big canal; that would be just as dangerous for him as it would be for us to go over a waterfall.\n\nNow he was so near it that he could not hold on any longer. The boat moved on, the poor tin soldier keeping himself as stiff as he could: no one should say of him afterwards that he had flinched. The boat whirled three, four times round, and became full to the brim of water; it began to sink. The tin soldier was now up to his neck in water, and deeper and deeper sank the boat, and softer and softer grew the paper: now the water was over his head. He thought of the little dancer, whom he was never to see again, and there sounded in his ears, over and over:\n\n“Forward, forward, soldier bold!\nDeath's the end that all must hold.”\n\nThe paper came in two, and the soldier fell—but at the same moment he was swallowed by a great fish.\n\nOh! how dark it was inside that fish: it was darker than under the culvert even; and it was close, but the tin soldier lay steadfast, with gun to shoulder.\n\nThen the fish swam to and fro; he made the most dreadful contortions, and then lay still. At last something flashed through him like lightning. The daylight streamed in on him, and some one cried out, “A tin soldier!” The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold, and brought into the kitchen, where the girl cut him open with a great knife. She took the soldier up by the waist, with two fingers, and carried him into the parlor, where everyone wanted to see the wonderful man who had traveled about inside a fish; but the tin soldier was not at all proud. They set him on the table, and there—well, what strange things do happen in this world!—the tin soldier was in the same room in which he had been before. He saw the same children, and the same toys on the table: the beautiful castle with the pretty little dancer. She still stood on one leg with the other high in the air; she too was steadfast. That touched the tin soldier, he was nearly going to shed tin-tears; but that would not have been fitting for a soldier. He looked at her, but he said nothing.\n\nSuddenly the boy took the tin soldier and threw him into the stove, for no reason whatever. But doubtless the little imp in the snuffbox was at the bottom of this too.\n\nThe tin soldier stood wrapped in a blaze, and felt a terrible heat, but whether it was the heat of the fire or the heat of his love he didn't know. He'd lost his splendid colors, and looked gray. Whether that had happened on the journey or had to do with sorrow, who can say?\n\nHe looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting; but he remained steadfast, with gun to shoulder. Then a door opened, the draught took up the little dancer, and she flew like a sylph straight into the stove to the tin soldier; up she flared in flame—and was gone. The tin soldier melted down to a lump, and when next day the maid raked out the ashes she found him in the shape of a heart. There was nothing left of the little dancer but her spangle; and it was burnt coal-black."

      "text": "I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instill is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,—and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThere is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preëstablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.\n\nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.\n\nWhat pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and behavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold, then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.\n\nThe nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about consequences about interests; he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges and, having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence,—must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in fear.\n\nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.\n\nWhoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying: “What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?” my friend suggested,—“But these impulses may be from below, not from above.” I replied, “They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil.” No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, ‘Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper; be good-natured and modest; have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at home.’ Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it,—else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached, as the counteraction of the doctrine of love, when that pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, *Whim*. I hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company. Then again, do not tell me, as a good man did today, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they *my* poor? I tell thee thou foolish philanthropist that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots, and the thousand-fold Relief Societies;—though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar, which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.\n\nVirtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man *and* his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,—as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.\n\nWhat I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.\n\nThe objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers,—under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blindman's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and sermon the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean “the foolish face of praise,” the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease, in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face, with the most disagreeable sensation.\n\nFor nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loth to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.—‘Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.’—Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.\n\nI suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;—read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.\n\nThere will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can be firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Always scorn appearances and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels. That is it which throws thunder into Chatham's voice, and dignity into Washington's port, and America into Adams's eye. Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemera. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage because it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.\n\nI hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward. Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you and all men and all events. Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much that he must make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design;—and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, Monachism, of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton called “the height of Rome”; and all history Resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.\n\nLet a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper in the world which exists for him. But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like that, ‘Who are you, Sir?’ Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince.\n\nOur reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history our imagination plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends on your private act to-day as followed their public and renowned steps. When private men shall act with original views, the luster will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen.\n\nThe world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man.\n\nThe magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist and afterwards see them as appearances in nature and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving;—the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time all mankind,—although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.\n\nThe relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away,—means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it,—one as much as another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and in the universal miracle petty and particular miracles disappear. If therefore a man claims to know and speak of God and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence then this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light: where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say ‘I think,’ ‘I am,’ but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied and it satisfies nature in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nThis should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see,—painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them and are willing to let the words go; for at any time they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.\n\nAnd now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition. That thought by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;—the way, the thought, the good shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea; long intervals of time, years, centuries, are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.\n\nLife only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates; that the soul *becomes*; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside. Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is present there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies because it works and is. Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric when we speak of eminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.\n\nThis is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every topic, the resolution of all into God. God is here within. Theism is the Puritanism of the intellect. It is the purification of the human mind. Man is the facade of the temple wherein all wisdom and all good abide. What we commonly call man, the eating, drinking, planting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but misrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the soul, whose organ he is, would he let it appear through his action, would make our knees bend. When it breathes through his intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his will, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it is love. And the blindness of the intellect begins when it would be something of itself. The weakness of the will begins when the individual would be something of himself. All reform aims in some one particular to let the soul have its way through us; in other words, to engage us to obey.\n\nOf this pure nature every man is at some time sensible. Language cannot paint it with his colors. It is too subtile. It is undefinable, unmeasurable; but we know that it pervades and contains us. We know that all spiritual being is in man. A wise old proverb says, “God comes to see us without bell”; that is, as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The walls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we see and know, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they tower over us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them.\n\nThe sovereignty of this nature appears in the productions of its wrath. When we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by manifold natural objects. It is this which distinguishes the stick of timber of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet. The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the best part of these men's farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.\n\nTo speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. His intercourse with heaven and earth, becomes part of his daily food. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says,—he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight; for every hour and change corresponds to and authorizes a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight. Nature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning piece. In good health, the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,—no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances,—master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.\n\nThe greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm, is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.\n\nYet it is certain that the power to produce this delight, does not reside in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For, nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs, is overspread with melancholy today. Nature always wears the colors of the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population."

      "text": "OUR age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us by the powers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are new lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and worship.\n\nUndoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswerable. We must trust the perfection of the creation so far, as to believe that whatever curiosity the order of things has awakened in our minds, the order of things can satisfy. Every man's condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries he would put. He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth. In like manner, nature is already, in its forms and tendencies, describing its own design. Let us interrogate the great apparition, that shines so peacefully around us. Let us inquire, to what end is nature?\n\nAll science has one aim, namely, to find a theory of nature. We have theories of races and of functions, but scarcely yet a remote approach to an idea of creation. We are now so far from the road to truth, that religious teachers dispute and hate each other, and speculative men are esteemed unsound and frivolous. But to a sound judgment, the most abstract truth is the most practical. Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is, that it will explain all phenomena. Now many are thought not only unexplained but inexplicable; as language, sleep, madness, dreams, beasts, sex.\n\nPhilosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul. Strictly speaking, therefore, all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men and my own body, must be ranked under this name, NATURE. In enumerating the values of nature and casting up their sum, I shall use the word in both senses;—in its common and in its philosophical import. In inquiries so general as our present one, the inaccuracy is not material; no confusion of thought will occur. *Nature*, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by man; space, the air, the river, the leaf. *Art* is applied to the mixture of his will with the same things, as in a house, a canal, a statue, a picture. But his operations taken together are so insignificant, a little chipping, baking, patching, and washing, that in an impression so grand as that of the world on the human mind, they do not vary the result.\n\nNATURE.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTO go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.\n\nThe stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man extort her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her perfection. Nature never became a toy to a wise spirit. The flowers, the animals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had delighted the simplicity of his childhood.\n\nWhen we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by manifold natural objects. It is this which distinguishes the stick of timber of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet. The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond.

      "text": "Economy\n\nWhen I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.\n\nI should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of these questions in this book. In most books, the *I*, or first person, is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.\n\nI would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England; something about your condition, especially your outward condition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Bramins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward, over flames; or lying on the points of sharp spikes; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach”; or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars—even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor. They have no friend Iolaus to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydra's head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.\n\nI see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man's life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well-nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and woodlot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.\n\nBut men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind them:—\n\nInde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,\n\nEt documenta damus qua simus origine nati.\n\nOr, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,—\n\n“From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,\n\nApproving that our bodies of a stony nature are.”\n\nSo much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.\n\nMost men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he remember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.\n\nSome of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are sometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the Latins *æs alienum*, another's brass, for some of their coins were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other's brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not state-prison offenses; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that you may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how little.\n\nI sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both North and South. It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate. Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and imagination,—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think, also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.\n\nThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.\n\nWhen we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What old people say you cannot do, you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once, perchance, to fetch new fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned anything of absolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose. Here is the life before me, and I have not experience enough to turn it to any account. It is a singular fact that a man may be said to have lived years in this world without having learned the lesson of life. If we should really be as wise as we are old, we should be able to give the young the benefit of our experience, but we are not. The old are in a second childhood. They have acquired a new set of toys and have partly lost the power of playing with them, yet they wish to instruct the world.\n\nThe nations are also in their second childhood. They have forgotten the days of their youth, and are burdened with the cares of the present. They are making the same mistakes that their fathers made, and will go on making them to the end of time. The history of the world is the history of its blunders. The sins of the fathers are visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. The world is always in its dotage.\n\nI find that whatever I do, I am pretty sure to come to the conclusion that it would have been better to have done differently. If I stay at home, I wish I had gone abroad; if I go abroad, I wish I had stayed at home. If I work, I wish I had played; if I play, I wish I had worked. If I save, I wish I had spent; if I spend, I wish I had saved. If I speak, I wish I had held my tongue; if I hold my tongue, I wish I had spoken. If I eat heartily, I wish I had eaten less; if I eat less, I wish I had eaten more. If I go to bed early, I wish I had sat up late; if I sit up late, I wish I had gone to bed early. If I buy, I wish I had sold; if I sell, I wish I had bought. If I lend, I wish I had borrowed; if I borrow, I wish I had lent. If I give, I wish I had received; if I receive, I wish I had given. If I love, I wish I had hated; if I hate, I wish I had loved. If I laugh, I wish I had cried; if I cry, I wish I had laughed. If I hope, I wish I had despaired; if I despair, I wish I had hoped. If I live, I wish I had died; if I die, I wish I had lived.\n\nThis is the way of the world. It is the way of all flesh. It is the way of the flesh-pots. It is the way of all flesh-pots. It is the way of all flesh-pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots. It is the way of all pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans. It is the way of all pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets. It is the way of all skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles. It is the way of all griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans. It is the way of all frying-pans and griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans and saucepans. It is the way of all saucepans and frying-pans and griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans and saucepans and stew-pans. It is the way of all stew-pans and saucepans and frying-pans and griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans and saucepans and stew-pans and boilers. It is the way of all boilers and stew-pans and saucepans and frying-pans and griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans and saucepans and stew-pans and boilers and cauldrons. It is the way of all cauldrons and boilers and stew-pans and saucepans and frying-pans and griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans and saucepans and stew-pans and boilers and cauldrons and chafing-dishes. It is the way of all chafing-dishes and cauldrons and boilers and stew-pans and saucepans and frying-pans and griddles and skillets and pans and pots and kettles. It is the way of all kettles and pots and pans and skillets and griddles and frying-pans and saucepans and stew-pans and boilers and cauldrons and chafing-dishes and skillets. Wait, that's repeating.\n\nI think I've got the point. The world is always in its dotage, making the same mistakes over and over again. It's like a broken record, playing the same tune over and over. But perhaps there's hope. Perhaps we can learn from our mistakes and break the cycle. Perhaps we can find a way to live in harmony with nature and with each other. Perhaps we can find a way to be truly free.\n\nBut that's a big perhaps. The world is a complicated place, full of contradictions and paradoxes. It's hard to know what to do, hard to know what's right. But one thing is certain: we must keep trying. We must keep striving for a better world, a world where everyone can live in peace and prosperity. We must keep fighting for justice and equality, for freedom and democracy. We must keep believing in the power of the human spirit, in the power of love and compassion. We must keep hoping for a brighter future, for a world where all our dreams can come true.\n\nSo let's raise a glass to hope, to the future, to a better world. Let's toast to the power of the human spirit, to the power of love and compassion. Let's drink to the day when all our dreams will come true.\n\nCheers!"

Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe—“That government is best which governs not at all;” and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure.\n\nThis American government,—what is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they should use it in earnest as a real one against each other, it will surely split. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow; yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. *It* does not keep the country free. *It* does not settle the West. *It* does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient, by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it. Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India rubber, would never manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.\n\nBut, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but *at once* a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it.\n\nAfter all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which the majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?—in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume, is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation *with* a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for the law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, aye, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit the Navy Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts, a mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniment, though it may be\n\n“Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,\n\n    As his corpse to the ramparts we hurried;\n\nNot a soldier discharged his farewell shot\n\n    O’er the grave where our hero we buried.”\n\nThe mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers, constables, *posse comitatus*, &c. In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw, or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens. Others, as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders, serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without *intending* it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and *men*, serve the State with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and they are commonly treated by it as enemies. A wise man will only be useful as a man, and will not submit to be “clay,” and “stop a hole to keep the wind away,” but leave that office to his dust at least:\n\n“I am too high-born to be propertied,\n\nTo be a secondary at control,\n\nOr useful serving-man and instrument\n\nTo any sovereign state throughout the world.”\n\nHe who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them useless and selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and philanthropist."

      "text": "OF FRIENDSHIP\n\nHaving considered the proceedings of a painter that serves me, I had a mind to imitate his way. He chooses the fairest place and middle of any wall, or panelled work, and there makes a complete portrait of some one person; and then fills in the empty space around with grotesques, which are fantastic paintings whose attractiveness consists in their variety and strangeness. And in truth, what are these Essays but grotesques and monstrous bodies, pieced together of divers members, without definite form, having no order, sequence, or proportion other than accidental?\n\nA fair woman ends in the tail of a fish.\n\nI can indeed endure to go as far as the painters in the second kind of painting, but I fall short in the first and better sort; for my ability does not go far enough for me to dare to undertake a rich, polished picture, formed according to art. It has therefore pleased me to take a hand at making one of La Boétie, to which I may add color and beauty at will. But every man according to his ability.\n\nAnd his is so great that no one has approached him. For me, who have undertaken to publish his writings, it would be a great disgrace and one that would fall on me as much as on any other, if I did not place in the front of this volume, as a true portrait of him, the little treatise of the Voluntary Servitude, which has since been usurped under the title of Le Contre Un. It is a little essay written in his early youth, in honor of liberty against tyrants. It has long been in the hands of men of understanding, not without great and well-merited commendation; for it is a fine thing, and as full as can be. Still there is much better in him; he would have done much more and better if he had not made a French translation of it, but had written it in Latin, which he intended to do, but gave up the idea. It is the only thing he wrote in French, except a few letters to me; all the rest of his writings are in Latin or Greek.\n\nBut it is excusable in him that at the age of eighteen or nineteen years, when he wrote it, he did not do better. For I doubt if there is any other Frenchman who has written so purely and correctly in his language as he in this little treatise. And he was without a model; for before him no one had written anything in French worthy of being read, except the Calvinists, who wrote tolerably well, but far from his style.\n\nI have, to complete the work, caused to be printed with it some Latin poems which are also his. They are good and worthy of him, but much inferior to his French, which is this little treatise. He made them in his childhood — at the age of thirteen or fourteen. He never wrote anything else in French except letters, of which I have a good number written in his own hand, addressed to me, all good and worthy of such a man. But the trouble is that I lent them to a gentleman of good position, who lent them in turn to others, and so they go from hand to hand; and I cannot get them back. I have had copies made, which are still in my possession; but I do not know if I shall publish them. For they are on the subject of love, which, although it well befitted his age (for he died young, at the age of thirty-two or thirty-three years), does not befit my old age.\n\nThe treatise of the Voluntary Servitude is a little pamphlet that has been highly prized heretofore, but little known; that is why it has been inserted here, in order that it may be known and better seen than it has been. It was loaned to me by the late Monsieur de Montaigne, who had it from the author himself, and he wished to have it printed, but the troubles of the civil wars which were then beginning made him neglect it. I have had it printed in honor of both of them, who were friends such as have never been seen in this country; and it is a great honor for Monsieur de Montaigne to have been so closely united with such a man. For he was so great that no such man has appeared since his time; and he will serve as an example to those who shall come after him. He was a man of rare qualities, and he would have been still greater if he had not died so young. He was learned in all sciences, and he was an excellent poet in Latin. He wrote a satire in the manner of Juvenal, which is full of fine things, but it is lost; for Monsieur de Montaigne never saw it, and it was never printed. He also wrote a book on the edicts of the Parliament of Bordeaux, which he presented to the King, and which was highly praised by all who saw it. But it was lost during the civil wars, and it is a great pity, for it was a work of great value.\n\nHe was a man of great judgment and of rare virtue; he was firm in his opinions and never changed them for any reason whatever. He was a good Catholic and very devout; he was charitable and liberal; he was brave and courageous; he was gentle and easy to deal with; he was faithful to his friends and very constant in his affections. He was a true friend, and the best that ever was. He loved virtue above all things, and hated vice; he was an enemy of all dissimulation and hypocrisy; he was frank and sincere; he was generous and magnanimous; he was wise and prudent; he was modest and humble; he was temperate and sober; he was chaste and continent; he was just and equitable; he was merciful and clement; he was patient and long-suffering; he was grateful and recognizing; he was laborious and diligent; he was vigilant and careful; he was discreet and secret; he was affable and courteous; he was cheerful and pleasant; he was ingenious and inventive; he was eloquent and persuasive; he was learned and knowledgeable; he was a good orator and a good writer; he was a good poet and a good musician; he was a good mathematician and a good astronomer; he was a good philosopher and a good theologian; he was a good jurist and a good physician; he was a good economist and a good soldier; he was a good citizen and a good friend; he was a good husband and a good father; he was a good master and a good servant; he was a good Christian and a good man. In short, he was a man accomplished in all virtues, both moral and intellectual, and he lacked nothing to be a perfect man.\n\nHe was born in the year 1530, in the city of Bordeaux, of a noble family, and he was educated in the College of Guienne, where he made great progress in letters. He was a good Latinist and a good Greek scholar, and he knew the Italian and Spanish languages. He was a good poet, as I have said, and he wrote a satire in Latin, which is lost, and some sonnets in French, which are printed at the end of this treatise. He was also a good musician, and he played the lute very well. He was a good mathematician, and he knew astronomy very well. He was a good philosopher, and he knew theology very well. He was a good jurist, and he knew the laws very well. He was a good physician, and he knew medicine very well. He was a good economist, and he knew how to manage his affairs very well. He was a good soldier, and he knew the art of war very well. He was a good citizen, and he loved his country very much. He was a good friend, and he was very faithful to his friends. He was a good husband, and he loved his wife very much. He was a good father, and he loved his children very much. He was a good master, and he treated his servants very well. He was a good servant, and he served his master very well. He was a good Christian, and he loved God very much. In short, he was a perfect man, and he lacked nothing to be so.\n\nHe died in the year 1563, on the thirteenth day of August, at the age of thirty-three years, and he was buried in the church of the Feuillants in Bordeaux, where there is a fine tomb with his statue in marble, and an epitaph in Latin, which I have not, but it is printed in the book of his works. He left a son, who died young, and a daughter, who married Monsieur de la Tour, a gentleman of Guienne, and she is still living.\n\nThis is what I have been able to learn of the life and death of this great man, who was the best friend that Monsieur de Montaigne ever had, and who loved him as much as he loved himself. And to show the affection which he had for him, he wrote a Latin poem in his praise, which is printed at the end of this treatise, and which is very beautiful and very learned.\n\nNow, as to the treatise itself, it is a little discourse which La Boétie wrote in his youth, against tyrants and tyranny, and in favor of liberty and the republic. It is written in French, and it is very well written, and very eloquent, and very learned. It is full of fine things, and of good and solid reasons, and of beautiful passages from the ancients. It is a work worthy of such a man, and it is a pity that it is not longer. But it is sufficient to show the spirit and the courage of the author, who dared to write against tyrants at a time when tyranny was so powerful and so dreaded.\n\nThis treatise was loaned to Monsieur de Montaigne by the author himself, and he wished to have it printed with his Essays, but he did not do so, because he feared that it might be misused by the Huguenots, who were then in arms against the King. But after his death, it was printed with his Essays, and it has been much admired and much read ever since.\n\nI have caused it to be printed separately, in order that it may be better known and better appreciated, and I have added to it some Latin poems of the author, which are very good and very learned, and which show his great erudition and his great talent.\n\nI have also added a letter which he wrote to Monsieur de Montaigne, a little before his death, in which he commends himself to him, and begs him to remember him, and to take care of his wife and his children, and to distribute his papers and his books to his friends. This letter is very beautiful and very touching, and it shows the great affection which he had for Monsieur de Montaigne, and the great confidence which he had in him.\n\nThis is all that I have to say of this little treatise, and of its author, and I hope that it will be well received by all good men, and that it will serve to instruct and to edify those who read it."

      "text": "OF CANNIBALS\n\nWhen King Pyrrhus invaded Italy, having viewed and considered the order of the army the Romans sent out to meet him; “I know not,” said he, “what kind of barbarians” (for so the Greeks called all other nations) “these may be; but the disposition of this army that I see has nothing of barbarism in it.” As much said the Greeks of that which Flaminius brought into their country; and Philip, beholding from a hill the order and distribution of the Roman camp formed in his kingdom by Publius Sulpicius Galba, spake to the same effect. By which it appears how cautious men ought to be of taking things upon trust from vulgar opinion, and that we are to judge by the eye of reason, and not from common report.\n\nI long had a man in my house that lived ten or twelve years in the New World, discovered in these latter days, and in that part of it where Villegaignon landed,—[At Brazil, in 1557.]—which he called Antarctic France. This discovery of so vast a country seems to be of very great consideration. I cannot tell whether this be the same that the ancients called Atlantis, and which they say was an island greater than Africa and Asia put together; but supposing it were not, yet it is a world full of new things, and which may well be called a New World, since it has been but lately discovered, and is still in its infancy, and begins but now to be peopled by the Christians.\n\nThis man that I had was a plain ignorant fellow, which is a condition fit to bear true witness; for sharp and subtle people are more curious and inquisitive, and perceive more things; but they gloss and comment upon them, and to give the greater weight to their interpretation and make it convincing by its authority, they cannot forbear a little to alter the story; they never represent things to you simply as they are, but bend and disguise them according to the aspect they have seen them in; and to give credit to their judgment and attract you to it, are willing to help out the business a little with something of their own, and stretch and amplify the truth. We need a man either of irreproachable veracity, or so simple that he has not wherewithal to contrive and give likelihood to false inventions, and who has wedded himself to no theory. Mine was of this last kind; and besides this, he has at divers times brought to me several seamen and merchants who at the same time went the same voyage. I shall therefore content myself with his information, without inquiring what the cosmographers say to the contrary.\n\nWe should have topographers who would give us an exact account of the places they have been in. But because they have this advantage over us, to have seen Palestine, they would engross the privilege of telling us news of all the world. I would have every one write what he knows, and as much as he knows, not in this only, but in all other subjects; for such a one may have some particular knowledge and experience of the nature of such a river, or such a fountain, who in other things, knows no more than what everybody does, and yet to give a currency to his little pittance of learning, will undertake to write the whole body of physics: a vice from which great inconveniences derive their original.\n\nNow, to return to my subject, I find that there is nothing barbarous and savage in this nation, according to what I have been told, except that every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use in his own country. As, indeed, we have no other criterion of truth and reason than the example and idea of the opinions and customs of the place wherein we live: there we always find the perfect religion, the perfect government, the perfect and accomplished usage in all things. They are savages in the same way that we say fruits are wild, which nature produces of herself and by her ordinary course; whereas, in truth, we ought rather to call those wild whose natures we have changed by our artifice and diverted from the common order. In those, the genuine, most useful, and natural virtues and properties are vigorous and active, which we have degenerated in these, and have only adapted to the pleasure of our corrupted palate. And yet for all this, the savor and delicacy of several fruits of those countries are excellent, even to our taste, and are not inferior to our own. 'Tis not reasonable that art should win the place of honour over our great and powerful mother Nature. We have so surcharged her with the additional ornaments and graces we have added to the beauty and riches of her own works by our inventions, that we have almost smothered her; yet in other places, where she shines in all her purity and proper luster, she marvellously baffles and disgraces all our vain and frivolous attempts:\n\nThe ivy comes readier without our help; and the arbutus\n\nGrows more concealed, and birds sing sweeter notes\n\nWhere no man's art has taught their melody.\n\nAll things, says Plato, are produced either by nature, by fortune, or by art; the greatest and most beautiful by the one or the other of the former, the least and the most imperfect by the last.\n\nThese nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received but very little form and fashion from art and human invention, and therefore to lie not much remote from their original simplicity. The laws of nature, however, govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with any mixture of ours: but 'tis in such purity, that I am sometimes troubled we were not sooner acquainted with these people, and that they happened not to come under the cognizance of our century, the age of our ancient authors. I am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato had no knowledge of them; for to my apprehension, what we now see in those nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the poets have adorned the golden age, and all their inventions in feigning a happy state of man, but, moreover, the fancy and even the wish and desire of philosophy itself; so native and so pure a simplicity, as we by experience see to be in them, could never enter into their imagination, nor could they ever believe that human society could have been maintained with so little artifice and human patchwork. I should tell Plato that it is a nation wherein there is no manner of traffic, no knowledge of letters, no science of numbers, no name of magistrate or political superiority; no use of service, riches or poverty, no contracts, no successions, no dividends, no properties, no employments, but those of leisure, no respect of kindred, but common, no clothing, no agriculture, no metal, no use of corn or wine; the very words that signify lying, treachery, dissimulation, avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard of. How much would he find his imaginary Republic short of his perfection?\n\nMen fresh sprung from the gods.\n\nThese manners nature first ordained.\n\nAs to the rest, they live in a country very pleasant and temperate, so that, as my witnesses inform me, 'tis rare to hear of a sick person, and they moreover assure me, that they never saw any of the natives, either paralytic, bleareyed, toothless, or crooked with age. The situation of their country is along the sea-shore, enclosed on the other side towards the land, with great and high mountains, having about a hundred leagues in breadth between. They have great store of fish and flesh, that have no resemblance to those of ours: which they eat without any other cookery, than plain boiling, roasting, or broiling, and are accustomed to devour them raw. The first that rode a horse thither, though in several other voyages he had contracted an acquaintance and familiarity with them, put them into so terrible a fright, with his hideous appearance, that they killed him with their arrows before they could come to discover who he was. Their buildings are very long, and of capacity to hold two or three hundred people, made of the barks of tall trees, reared with one end upon the ground, and leaning to and supporting one another at the top, like some of our barns, of which the covering hangs down to the ground, and serves for the side walls. They have wood so hard, that they cut with it, and make their swords of it, and also spits for roasting their meat. Their beds are of cotton, hung swinging from the roof, like our seamen's hammocks, every man his own, for the wives lie apart from their husbands. They rise with the sun, and no sooner up but eat for all day, having no other meal but that: for drinking, some of them drink nothing at all; but most of them drink wine of the palm-tree, which they extract in this manner: They make a hole in the upper part of the tree, and put in a vessel, which they leave there for some days, and take it out full of liquor. It is a most delicious beverage, of a very agreeable taste, when it is fresh; but when it is old, it becomes harsh and unpleasant. They have a number of such trees in their fields. They have great store of those that bear cocoa-nuts, figs, and all other fruits of those countries: they have no other subsistence but what that land affords them, and they are so liberal of it, that they will not stick to give away all they have, when they meet one they like, but part with it cheerfully. They are very jealous of their wives, and the least suspicion incenses them to that degree, that they beat them inhumanly, and kill them without pity. But their jealousy is only for themselves; for they lend their wives to strangers, and are even glad to see them well married, and have children by them, thinking that by this means they shall have more friends and adherents in their quarrels and wars. Their wars are all against people beyond the mountains, whither they go naked, with no other arms than bows or wooden swords sharpened at one end, like our spits. It is astonishing what firmness they show in their combats, which never end but by slaughter and effusion of blood; for as to running away, they never think of it. Every one for a trophy brings home the head of an enemy he has killed, which he fixes over the door of his house. After having a long time treated their prisoners well, and given them all the regales they can think of, he to whom the prisoner belongs, invites a great assembly of his friends. They being come, he ties a rope to one of the arms of the prisoner, of which, at a distance, out of his reach, he holds the one end himself, and gives to the friend he loves best the other arm to hold after the same manner; which being done, they two, in the presence of all the assembly, dispatch him with their swords. After that, they roast him, eat him amongst them, and send some chops to their absent friends. They do not do this, as some think, for nourishment, as the Scythians anciently did, but as a representation of an extreme revenge. The proof of this came thus: Having perceived that the Portuguese, who were cut to pieces in their sight, before death, caused their heads to be struck off, and then buried them in holes, and did many other barbarities to the living, which indeed was horrible, yet they thought that these people from the other world (as being men who had sown the knowledge of many vices amongst their neighbors, and were much greater masters in all manner of mischief than themselves) had some reason for what they did, and that it was not out of stupidity that they thus treated their prisoners; but that, having a horror at being eaten after they were dead, they chose rather to be buried. I conversed a long time with one of them, but I had so bad an interpreter, who, moreover, was so much more stupid than I, that I could get but little satisfaction from him. When I asked him what benefit he received from the superiority he had amongst his own people (for he was a captain, and our sailors called him king), he told me, to march at the head of them to war. I then asked him how many men he had to follow him; he showed me a space of ground, to signify as many as could march in such a compass, which might be four or five thousand men; and putting the question to him whether or no his authority expired with the war, he told me this remained then: that when he went to visit the villages of his friends, they made him a seat, and caused him to sit down, which being done, all the people about him stood up with their eyes fixed upon him, and clapped their hands as the utmost token of respect. This seemed to me a singularly noble action. He told me also that they had no other food but fish and the flesh of their enemies, which they ate raw, and that they had no other drink but water, and that they were very healthy and long-lived. I asked him if they had any religion or any knowledge of God; he said no, that they believed there was no God, and that when they died they were buried, and that was the end of them. I asked him if they had any laws or any form of government; he said no, that they lived in common, and that they had no king or lord, but that the old men chastised the young when they did amiss, and that was all. I asked him if they married; he said yes, that they took as many wives as they pleased, and that the mothers married their sons and the fathers their daughters, and the brothers their sisters, and that they all lived together in one house, and that the children belonged to all. I asked him if they had any wars; he said yes, with the nations beyond the mountains, and that they went to war naked, with bows and arrows, and swords made of wood, and that they fought till one party or the other was defeated, and that the conquerors made prisoners of the conquered, and carried them home, and ate them, but that they did not eat them presently, but kept them a long time, and treated them well, and gave them wives and all that they wanted, and when they were fat they killed them and ate them, and that this was the reason why they were so fat, and that they did this to revenge the death of their fathers and grandfathers, who had been eaten by their enemies. I asked him if they ate women as well as men; he said no, that they only ate the men, and that the women were for breeding and for service. I asked him if they had any money or any thing to buy with; he said no, that they had all things in common, and that they gave every one what he wanted. I asked him if they had any kings or lords; he said no, that they were all equal, and that when they went to war they chose the bravest and the most valiant for their captain, and that they obeyed him as long as the war lasted, and no longer. I asked him if they had any religion or any priests; he said no, that they believed that there was a God who made all things, but that they did not know where he was, and that they did not pray to him, but that when they died they went to the stars. I asked him if they had any justice or any punishment for malefactors; he said no, that they did not punish any body but traitors and cowards, and that they killed them and ate them. I asked him if they were afraid of death; he said no, that they died as willingly as they went to bed, and that they sang when they were going to die. I asked him if they had any physicians or any medicines; he said no, that when they were sick they ate nothing, and that they recovered or died. I asked him if they had any fruits or any corn; he said yes, that they had a kind of corn which they pounded and made cakes of it, and that they had many sorts of fruits, and that they ate them raw, and that they had no fire but to warm themselves. I asked him if they had any beasts or any fowls; he said yes, that they had a kind of fowl like a goose, which they killed with arrows, and ate, and that they had no other beasts but monkeys and parrots, which they ate also. I asked him if they had any fish; he said yes, that they had great store of fish, which they caught with hooks made of bones, and that they ate them raw. I asked him if they had any salt; he said no, that they seasoned their meat with a kind of root which was very hot. I asked him if they had any wine or any other liquor; he said no, that they drank water, but that they had a kind of drink made of roots which was very good. I asked him if they had any gold or silver; he said no, that they had no use for it, and that they did not know what it was. I asked him if they had any iron or any other metal; he said no, that they had a kind of white metal which they used for ornaments. I asked him if they had any spices or any sweet woods; he said yes, that they had cinnamon and cloves and other spices, and that they used them for perfume. I asked him if they had any precious stones; he said no, that they had no use for them. I asked him if they had any clothes; he said no, that they went naked, both men and women, and that they were not ashamed of it. I asked him if they had any houses; he said yes, that they had long houses made of wood, covered with palm leaves, and that many families lived in one house. I asked him if they had any beds; he said yes, that they had hammocks made of cotton, which they hung to the roof of the house. I asked him if they had any boats or any canoes; he said yes, that they had canoes made of one tree, which held forty or fifty men, and that they went to sea in them, and fished and traded with their neighbors. I asked him if they had any enemies; he said yes, that they had many enemies, and that they went to war with them, and that they fought with bows and arrows and clubs, and that they took prisoners and ate them.

Whence springs\n\n  The inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,\n\n  Barring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!\n\n  Forbid thyself to feebleness! it mars\n\n  Thy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!\n\n  Wake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!\n\nArjuna.\n\n  How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts\n\n  On Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!--\n\n  Both worshipful, both honourable men?\n\nBetter to live on beggar's bread\n\n    With those we love alive,\n\n  Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread,\n\n    And guiltily survive!\n\n  Ah! were it worse-who knows?--to be\n\n    Victor or vanquished here,\n\n  When those confront us angrily\n\n    Whose death leaves living drear?\n\n  In pity lost, by doubtings tossed,\n\n    My thoughts-distracted-turn\n\n  To Thee, the Guide I reverence most,\n\n    That I may counsel learn:\n\n  I know not what would heal the grief\n\n    Burned into soul and sense,\n\n  If I were earth's unchallenged chief--\n\n    A god--and these gone thence!\n\nSanjaya.\n\n  So spake Arjuna to the Lord of  Hearts,\n\n  And sighing,\"I will not fight!\" held silence then.\n\n  To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata! )\n\n  While the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts,\n\n  Krishna made answer in divinest verse:\n\nKrishna.\n\n  Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st\n\n  Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart\n\n  Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.\n\n  Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,\n\n  Ever was not, nor ever will not be,\n\n  For ever and for ever afterwards.\n\n  All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame\n\n  As there come infancy and youth and age,\n\n  So come there raisings-up and layings-down\n\n  Of other and of other life-abodes,\n\n  Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks--\n\n  Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements--\n\n  Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,\n\n  'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!\n\n  As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,\n\n  The soul that with a strong and constant calm\n\n  Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,\n\n  Lives in the life undying! That which is\n\n  Can never cease to be; that which is not\n\n  Will not exist. To see this truth of both\n\n  Is theirs who part essence from accident,\n\n  Substance from shadow. Indestructible,\n\n  Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;\n\n  It cannot anywhere, by any means,\n\n  Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.\n\n  But for these fleeting frames which it informs\n\n  With spirit deathless, endless, infinite,\n\n  They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!\n\n  He who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"\n\n  He who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both\n\n  Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!\n\n  Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;\n\n  Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!\n\n  Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;\n\n  Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!\n\nWho knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,\n\n  Immortal, indestructible,--shall such\n\n  Say, \"I have killed a man, or caused to kill?\"\n\nNay, but as when one layeth\n\n    His worn-out robes away,\n\n  And taking new ones, sayeth,\n\n    \"These will I wear to-day!\"\n\n  So putteth by the spirit\n\n    Lightly its garb of flesh,\n\n  And passeth to inherit\n\n    A residence afresh.\n\nI say to thee weapons reach not the Life;\n\n  Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm,\n\n  Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,\n\n  Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,\n\n  Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,\n\n  Invisible, ineffable, by word\n\n  And thought uncompassed, ever all itself,\n\n  Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,--\n\n  Knowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?\n\n  How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead\n\n  Is, like the man new-born, still living man--\n\n  One same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep?\n\n  The end of birth is death; the end of death\n\n  Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,\n\n  Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls\n\n  Which could not otherwise befall? The birth\n\n  Of living things comes unperceived; the death\n\n  Comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:\n\n  What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?\n\nWonderful, wistful, to contemplate!\n\n    Difficult, doubtful, to speak upon!\n\n  Strange and great for tongue to relate,\n\n    Mystical hearing for every one!\n\n  Nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,\n\n    When seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!\n\nThis Life within all living things, my Prince!\n\n  Hides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,\n\n  For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!\n\n  Be mindful of thy name, and tremble not!\n\n  Nought better can betide a martial soul\n\n  Than lawful war; happy the warrior\n\n  To whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now,\n\n  Glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him\n\n  A gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st\n\n  This honourable field--a Kshattriya--\n\n  If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st\n\n  Duty and task go by--that shall be sin!\n\n  And those to come shall speak thee infamy\n\n  From age to age; but infamy is worse\n\n  For men of noble blood to bear than death!\n\n  The chiefs upon their battle-chariots\n\n  Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.\n\n  Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn\n\n  Thou must abide, while all thine enemies\n\n  Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock\n\n  The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall\n\n  More grievously than this? Either--being killed--\n\n  Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or--alive\n\n  And victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king.\n\n  Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace\n\n  Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet--\n\n  As things alike to thee--pleasure or pain,\n\n  Profit or ruin, victory or defeat:\n\n  So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so\n\n  Thou shalt not sin!\n\nThus far I speak to thee\n\n  As from the \"Sankhya\"--unspiritually--\n\n  Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,\n\n  Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst\n\n  Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.\n\n  Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,\n\n  No loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith--\n\n  Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.\n\n  Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule--\n\n  One steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws\n\n  Many and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem\n\n  The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol\n\n  The letter of their Vedas, saying, \"This\n\n  Is all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart\n\n  With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--\n\n  As \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men\n\n  Much profit in new births for works of faith;\n\n  In various rites abounding; following whereon\n\n  Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;\n\n  Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire\n\n  Least fixity of soul have such, least hold\n\n  On heavenly meditation. Much these teach,\n\n  From Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"\n\n  But thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"\n\n  Free of the \"pairs of opposites,\"[FN#2] and free\n\n  From that sad righteousness which calculates;\n\n  Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied![FN#3]\n\n  Look! like as when a tank pours water forth\n\n  To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw\n\n  Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.\n\n  But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward\n\n  Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be\n\n  Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.\n\n  And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts\n\n  Thy piety, casting all self aside,\n\n  Contemning gain and merit; equable\n\n  In good or evil: equability\n\n  Is Yog, is piety!\n\nYet, the right act\n\n  Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.\n\n  Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!\n\n  Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!\n\n  The mind of pure devotion--even here--\n\n  Casts equally aside good deeds and bad,\n\n  Passing above them. Unto pure devotion\n\n  Devote thyself: with perfect meditation\n\n  Comes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise--\n\n  More certainly because they seek no gain--\n\n  Forth from the bands of body, step by step,\n\n  To highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul\n\n  Hath shaken off those tangled oracles\n\n  Which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar\n\n  To high neglect of what's denied or said,\n\n  This way or that way, in doctrinal writ.\n\n  Troubled no longer by the priestly lore,\n\n  Safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent\n\n  On meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!\n\nArjuna.\n\n  What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,\n\n  Confirmed in holy meditation? How\n\n  Know we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he\n\n  Like other men?\n\nKrishna.\n\n  When one, O Pritha's Son!\n\n  Abandoning desires which shake the mind--\n\n  Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul,\n\n  He hath attained the Yog--that man is such!\n\n  In sorrows not dejected, and in joys\n\n  Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress\n\n  Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms\n\n  Of lofty contemplation;--such an one\n\n  Is Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!\n\n  He who to none and nowhere overbound\n\n  By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good\n\n  Neither desponding nor exulting, such\n\n  Bears wisdom's plainest mark! He who shall draw\n\n  As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe\n\n  Under its shield, his five frail senses back\n\n  Under the spirit's buckler from the world\n\n  Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince!\n\n  Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense\n\n  Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,\n\n  The appetites of him who lives beyond\n\n  Depart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance,\n\n  O Son of Kunti! that a governed mind\n\n  Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest\n\n  Strong self-control by the roots.

If one\n\n  Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs\n\n  Attraction; from attraction grows desire,\n\n  Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds\n\n  Recklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--\n\n  Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,\n\n  Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone.\n\n  But, if one deals with objects of the sense\n\n  Not loving and not hating, making them\n\n  Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord,\n\n  Lo! such a man comes to tranquillity;\n\n  And out of that tranquillity shall rise\n\n  The end and healing of his earthly pains,\n\n  Since the will governed sets the soul at peace.\n\n  The soul of the ungoverned is not his,\n\n  Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,\n\n  How grows serenity? and, wanting that,\n\n  Whence shall he hope for happiness?\n\nThe mind\n\n  That gives itself to follow shows of sense\n\n  Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away,\n\n  And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives\n\n  To wreck and death.

      "text": "# The Epic of Gilgamish\n\n## by\n\nStephen Langdon\n\n## University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe University Museum\n\nPublications of the Babylonian Section\n\nVol. X No. 3\n\n[ [207](#d0e100) ]\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the year 1914 the University Museum secured by purchase a large six column tablet nearly complete, carrying originally,\naccording to the scribal note, 240 lines of text. The contents supply the South Babylonian version of the second book of the\nepic *ša nagba imuru*, “He who has seen all things,” commonly referred to as the Epic of Gilgamish. The tablet is said to have been found at Senkere,\nancient Larsa near Warka, modern Arabic name for and vulgar descendant of the ancient name Uruk, the Biblical Erech mentioned\nin Genesis X. 10. This fact makes the new text the more interesting since the legend of Gilgamish is said to have originated\nat Erech and the hero in fact figures as one of the prehistoric Sumerian rulers of that ancient city. The dynastic list preserved\non a Nippur tablet[1](#d0e109) mentions him as the fifth king of a legendary line of rulers at Erech, who succeeded the dynasty of Kish, a city in North\nBabylonia near the more famous but more recent city Babylon. The list at Erech contains the names of two well known Sumerian\ndeities, Lugalbanda[2](#d0e115) and Tammuz. The reign of the former is given at 1,200 years and that of Tammuz at 100 years. Gilgamish ruled 126 years. We\nhave to do here with a confusion of myth and history in which the real facts are disengaged only by conjecture.\n\nThe prehistoric Sumerian dynasties were all transformed [ [208](#d0e120) ]into the realm of myth and legend. Nevertheless these rulers, although appearing in the pretentious nomenclature as gods,\nappear to have been real historic personages.[3](#d0e122) The name Gilgamish was originally written *d Gi-bil-aga-miš* , and means “The fire god ( *Gibil* ) is a commander,” abbreviated to *d Gi-bil-ga-miš* , and *d Gi(š)-bil-ga-miš* , a form which by full labialization of *b* to *u̯* was finally contracted to *d Gi-il-ga-miš* . [4](#d0e166) Throughout the new text the name is written with the abbreviation *d Gi(š)* , [5](#d0e177) whereas the standard Assyrian text has consistently the writing *d GIŠ-ṬU 6 -BAR* . The latter method of writing the name is apparently cryptographic for *d Giš-bar-aga-(miš)* ; the fire god *Gibil* has also the title *Giš-bar*.\n\nA fragment of the South Babylonian version of the tenth book was published in 1902, a text from the period of Hammurapi, which\nshowed that the Babylonian epic differed very much from the Assyrian in diction, but not in content. The new tablet, which\nbelongs to the same period, also differs radically from the diction of the Ninevite text in the few lines where they duplicate\neach other. The first line of the new tablet corresponds to Tablet I, Col. V 25 of the Assyrian text,[7](#d0e210) where Gilgamish begins to relate his dreams to his mother Ninsun. [8](#d0e219) [ [209](#d0e246) ]\n\nThe last line of Col. I corresponds to the Assyrian version Book I, Col. VI 29. From this point onward the new tablet takes\nup a hitherto unknown portion of the epic, henceforth to be assigned to the second book.[9](#d0e249)\n\nAt the end of Book I in the Assyrian text and at the end of Col. I of Book II in the new text, the situation in the legend\nis as follows. The harlot halts outside the city of Erech with the enamoured Enkidu, while she relates to him the two dreams\nof the king, Gilgamish. In these dreams which he has told to his mother he receives premonition concerning the advent of the\nsatyr Enkidu, destined to join with him in the conquest of Elam.\n\nNow the harlot urges Enkidu to enter the beautiful city, to clothe himself like other men and to learn the ways of civilization.\nWhen he enters he sees someone, whose name is broken away, eating bread and drinking milk, but the beautiful barbarian understands\nnot. The harlot commands him to eat and drink also:\n\n“It is the conformity of life,\n\nOf the conditions and fate of the Land.”\n\nHe rapidly learns the customs of men, becomes a shepherd and a mighty hunter. At last he comes to the notice of Gilgamish\nhimself, who is shocked by the newly acquired manner of Enkidu.\n\n“Oh harlot, take away the man,” says the lord of Erech. Once again the faithful woman instructs her heroic lover in the conventions\nof society, this time teaching him the importance of the family in Babylonian life, and obedience to the ruler. Now the people\nof Erech assemble about him admiring his [ [210](#d0e265) ]godlike appearance. Gilgamish receives him and they dedicate their arms to heroic endeavor. At this point the epic brings\nin a new and powerful *motif*, the renunciation of woman’s love in the presence of a great undertaking. Gilgamish is enamoured of the beautiful virgin\ngoddess Išhara, and Enkidu, fearing the effeminate effects of his friend’s attachment, prevents him forcibly from entering\na house. A terrific combat between these heroes ensues,[10](#d0e270) in which Enkidu conquers, and in a magnanimous speech he reminds Gilgamish of his higher destiny.\n\nIn another unplaced fragment of the Assyrian text [11](#d0e278) Enkidu rejects his mistress also, apparently on his own initiative and for ascetic reasons. This fragment, heretofore assigned\nto the second book, probably belongs to Book III. The tablet of the Assyrian version which carries the portion related on\nthe new tablet has not been found. Man redeemed from barbarism is the major theme of Book II.\n\nThe newly recovered section of the epic contains two legends which supplied the glyptic artists of Sumer and Accad with subjects\nfor seals. Obverse III 28–32 describes Enkidu the slayer of lions and panthers. Seals in all periods frequently represent\nEnkidu in combat with a lion. The struggle between the two heroes, where Enkidu strives to rescue his friend from the fatal\ncharms of Išhara, is probably depicted on seals also. On one of the seals published by Ward, *Seal Cylinders of Western Asia* , No. 459, a nude female stands beside the struggling heroes. [12](#d0e292) This scene not improbably illustrates the effort of Enkidu to rescue his friend from the goddess. In fact the satyr stands\nbetween Gilgamish and Išhara(?) on the seal.\n[ [211](#d0e295) ]\n\n---\n\n[1](#d0e109src) Ni. 13981, published by Dr. Poebel in PBS. V, No. 2.\n\n[2](#d0e115src) The local Bêl of Erech and a bye-form of Enlil, the earth god. Here he is the consort of the mother goddess Ninsun.\n\n[3](#d0e122src) Tammuz is probably a real personage, although *Dumu-zi* , his original name, is certainly later than the title *Ab-ú* , probably the oldest epithet of this deity, see *Tammuz and Ishtar* , p. 8. *Dumu-zi* I take to have been originally the name of a prehistoric ruler of Erech, identified with the primitive deity Abu.\n\n[4](#d0e166src) See *ibid.*, page 40.\n\n[5](#d0e177src) Also Meissner’s early Babylonian duplicate of Book X has invariably the same writing, see Dhorme, *Choix de Textes Religieux*, 298–303.\n\n[6](#d0e190src) Sign whose gunufied form is read *aga*.\n\n[7](#d0e210src) The standard text of the Assyrian version is by Professor Paul Haupt, *Das Babylonische Nimrodepos*, Leipzig, 1884.\n\n[8](#d0e219src) The name of the mother of Gilgamish has been erroneously read *ri-mat ilat Nin-lil* , or *Rimat-Bêlit* , see Dhorme 202, 37; 204, 30, etc. But Dr. Poebel, who also copied this text, has shown that *Nin-lil* is an erroneous reading for *Nin-sun* . For *Ninsun* as mother of Gilgamish see SBP. 153 n. 19 and R.A., IX 113 III 2. *Ri-mat ilat Nin-sun* should be rendered “The wild cow Ninsun.”\n\n[9](#d0e249src) The fragments which have been assigned to Book II in the British Museum collections by Haupt, Jensen, Dhorme and others belong\nto later tablets, probably III or IV.\n\n[10](#d0e270src) Rm. 289, latter part of Col. II (part of the Assyrian version) published in HAUPT, *ibid.*, 81–4 preserves a defective text of this part of the epic. This tablet has been erroneously assigned to Book IV, but it appears\nto be Book III.\n\n[11](#d0e278src) K. 2589 and duplicate (unnumbered) in Haupt, *ibid.*, 16–19.\n\n[12](#d0e292src) See also Ward, No. 199.\n\n## Transliteration\n\n1 it-bi-e-ma iluGilgamiš šu-na-tam i-pa-aš-šar.\n\n2 iz-za-kar-am [1](#d0e308) a-na um-mi-šu\n\n3um-mi i-na ša-a-at mu-ši-ti-i̭a\n\n4ša-am-ḫa-ku-ma at-ta-na-al-la-ak\n\n5i-na bi-ri-it id-da-tim\n\n6 ib-ba-šu-nim-ma ka-ka-’a [2](#d0e325) ša-ma-i\n\n7 ki-?-?-rum [3](#d0e339) ša a-nim im-ku-ut a-na ṣi-ri-i̭a\n\n8 áš-ši-šu-ma ik-ta-bi-it [4](#d0e350) e-li-i̭a\n\n9 ilam [5](#d0e357) iš-šu-ma nu-uš-ša-šu [6](#d0e377) u-ul el-ti-’i̭\n\n10 ad-ki ma-tum pa-ḫi-ir [7](#d0e391) e-li-šu\n\n11id-lu-tum ú-na-ša-ku ši-pi-šu\n\n12ú-um-mi-id-ma\t pu-ti\n\n13i-mi- du\t\t i̭a-ti\n\n14aš-ši-a-šu-ma at-ba-la-áš-šu a-na ṣi-ri-ki\n\n15 um-mi iluGilgamiš mu-u-da-a-at ka-la-ma\n\n16 iz-za-kar-am a-na iluGilgamiš\n[ [212](#d0e418) ]\n\n17 mi-in-di iluGilgamish ša ki-ma ka-ti\n\n18i-na ṣi-ri\t i-wa-li-id-ma\n\n19ú-ra-ab-bi-šu\t ša-du-ú\n\n20ta-mar-šu-ma [sa(?)]-ap-ḫa-ta at-ta\n\n21 id-lu-tum ú-na-ša-ku ši-pi-šu [8](#d0e432)\n\n22te-iṭ-ṭi-ra-šu(?) … šu-ú-zu\n\n23ta-tar-ra-[’a]-šu a-na ṣi-[ri-i̭]a\n\n24 [iš-(?)] ti-lam-ma [9](#d0e444) i-ta-mar ša-ni-tam\n\n25[šu-na-]ta i-ta-wa-a-am a-na um-mi-šu\n\n26[um-m]i a-ta-mar ša-ni-tam\n\n27[šu-na-ta a-ta]mar e-mi-a i-na zu-ki-im\n\n28 [i-na?] Unuk-(ki) ri-bi-tim [10](#d0e460)\n\n29ḫa-aṣ-ṣi-nu\t na-di-i-ma\n\n30e-li-šu\t pa-aḫ- ru\n\n31ḫa-aṣ-ṣi-nu-um-ma ša-ni bu-nu-šu\n\n32a-mur-šu-ma aḫ-ta-ta a-na-ku\n\n33a-ra-am-šu-ma ki-ma áš-ša-tim\n\n34a-ḫa-ap-pu-up\t el-šu\n\n35el-ki-šu-ma áš-ta-ka-an-šu\n\n36a-na\t a-ḫi-i̭a\n\n37 um-mi iluGilgamish mu-da-at ka-la-ma\n\n38 [iz-za-kar-am a-na iluGilgamish]\n\n...................................\n[ [213](#d0e500) ]\n\n### COL.

      "text": "# Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem\n\n## THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SCYLD.\n\nThe famous race of Spear-Danes.  \nLo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements  \nThe folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,  \nHow princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.  \n\nOft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers  \nFrom many a people their mead-benches tore.  \nSince first he found him friendless and wretched,  \nThe earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,  \nWaxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,  \nTill all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to  \nBow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:  \nAn excellent atheling! After was borne him  \nA son and heir, young in his dwelling,  \nWhom God-Father sent to solace the people.  \nHe had marked the misery malice had caused them,  \nThat reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile  \nLong been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,  \nWielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.  \nFamed was Beowulf, far spread the glory  \nOf Scyld’s great son in the lands of the Danemen.  \n\nSo the carle that is young, by kindnesses rendered  \nThe friends of his father, with fees in abundance  \nMust be able to earn that when age approacheth  \nEager companions aid him requitingly,  \nWhen war assaults him serve him as liegemen:  \nBy praise-worthy actions must honor be got  \n’Mong all of the races. At the hour that was fated  \nScyld then departed to the All-Father’s keeping  \nWarlike to wend him; away then they bare him  \nTo the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,  \nAs himself he had bidden, while the friend of the Scyldings  \nWord-sway wielded, and the well-lovèd land-prince  \nLong did rule them. The ring-stemmèd vessel,  \nBark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,  \nIcy in glimmer and eager for sailing;  \nThe belovèd leader laid they down there,  \nGiver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,  \nThe famed by the mainmast. A many of jewels,  \nOf fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,  \nWas placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever  \nThat a folk ever furnished a float more superbly  \nWith weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,  \nBills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled  \nMany a jewel that with him must travel  \nOn the flush of the flood afar on the current.  \nAnd favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,  \nExcellent folk-gems, than others had given him  \nWho when first he was born outward did send him  \nLone on the main, the merest of infants:  \nAnd a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven  \nHigh o’er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,  \nSeaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,  \nTheir mood very mournful. Men are not able  \nSoothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,  \nHeroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.  \n\n## SCYLD’S SUCCESSORS.—HROTHGAR’S GREAT MEAD-HALL.\n\nIn the boroughs then Beowulf, bairn of the Scyldings,  \nBelovèd land-prince, for long-lasting season  \nWas famed mid the folk (his father departed,  \nThe prince from his dwelling), till afterward sprang  \nGreat-minded Healfdene; the Danes in his lifetime  \nHe graciously governed, grim-mooded, agèd.  \n\nFour bairns of his body born in succession  \nWoke in the world, war-troopers’ leader  \nHeorogar, Hrothgar, and Halga the good;  \nHeard I that Elan was Ongentheow’s consort,  \nThe well-beloved bedmate of the War-Scylfing leader.  \n\nThen glory in battle to Hrothgar was given,  \nWaxing of war-fame, that willingly kinsmen  \nObeyed his bidding, till the boys grew to manhood,  \nA numerous band. It burned in his spirit  \nTo urge his folk to found a great building,  \nA mead-hall grander than men of the era  \nEver had heard of, and in it to share  \nWith young and old all of the blessings  \nThe Lord had allowed him, save life and retainers.  \nThen the work I find afar was assigned  \nTo many races in middle-earth’s regions,  \nTo adorn the great folk-hall. In due time it happened  \nEarly ’mong men, that ’twas finished entirely,  \nThe greatest of hall-buildings; Heorot he named it  \nWho wide-reaching word-sway wielded ’mong earlmen.  \nHis promise he brake not, rings he lavished,  \nTreasure at banquet. Towered the hall up  \nHigh and horn-crested, huge between antlers:  \nIt battle-waves bided, the blasting fire-demon;  \nEre long then from hottest hatred must sword-wrath  \nArise for a woman’s husband and father.  \n\nThen the mighty war-spirit endured for a season,  \nBore it bitterly, he who bided in darkness,  \nThat light-hearted laughter loud in the building  \nGreeted him daily; there was dulcet harp-music,  \nClear song of the singer. He said that was able  \nTo tell from of old earthmen’s beginnings,  \nThat Father Almighty earth had created,  \nThe winsome wold that the water encircleth,  \nSet exultingly the sun’s and the moon’s beams  \nTo lavish their lustre on land-folk and races,  \nAnd earth He embellished in all her regions  \nWith limbs and leaves; life He bestowed too  \nOn all the kindreds that live under heaven.  \n\nSo blessed with abundance, brimming with joyance,  \nThe warriors abided, till a certain one gan to  \nDog them with deeds of direfullest malice,  \nA foe in the hall-building: this horrible stranger  \nWas Grendel entitled, the march-stepper famous  \nWho dwelt in the moor-fens, the marsh and the fastness;  \nThe wan-mooded being abode for a season  \nIn the land of the giants, when the Lord and Creator  \nHad banned him and branded. For that bitter murder,  \nThe killing of Abel, all-ruling Father  \nThe kindred of Cain crushed with His vengeance;  \nIn the feud He rejoiced not, but far away drove him  \nFrom kindred and kind, that crime to atone for,  \nMeter of Justice. Thence ill-favored creatures,  \nElves and giants, monsters of ocean,  \nCame into being, and the giants that longtime  \nGrappled with God; He gave them requital.  \n\n## GRENDEL THE MURDERER.\n\nWhen the sun was sunken, he set out to visit  \nThe lofty hall-building, how the Ring-Danes had used it  \nFor beds and benches when the banquet was over.  \nThen he found there reposing many a noble  \nAsleep after supper; sorrow the heroes,  \nMisery knew not. The monster of evil  \nGreedy and cruel tarried but little,  \nFell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers  \nThirty of thanemen; thence he departed  \nLeaping and laughing, his lair to return to,  \nWith surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.  \n\nIn the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,  \nWas Grendel’s prowess revealed to the warriors:  \nThen, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,  \nMorning-cry mighty. The man-ruler famous,  \nThe long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,  \nSuffered great sorrow, sighed for his liegemen,  \nWhen they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer,  \nThe spirit accursèd: too crushing that sorrow,  \nToo loathsome and lasting. Not longer he tarried,  \nBut one night after continued his slaughter  \nShameless and shocking, shrinking but little  \nFrom malice and murder; they mastered him fully.  \nHe was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for  \nA pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,  \nA bed in the bowers. Then was brought to his notice  \nTold him truly by token apparent  \nThe hall-thane’s hatred: he held himself after  \nFurther and faster who the foeman did baffle.  \nSo ruled he and strongly strove against justice  \nLone against all men, till empty uptowered  \nThe choicest of houses. Long was the season:  \nTwelve-winters’ time torture suffered  \nThe friend of the Scyldings, every affliction,  \nEndless agony; hence it after became  \nCertainly known to the children of men  \nSadly in measures, that long against Hrothgar  \nGrendel struggled:—his grudges he cherished,  \nMurderous malice, many a winter,  \nStrife unremitting, and peacefully wished he  \nLife-woe to lift from no liegeman at all of  \nThe men of the Dane-folk, for money to settle,  \nNo counsellor needed count for a moment  \nOn handsome amends at the hands of the murderer;  \nThe monster of evil fiercely did harass,  \nThe ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger,  \nTrapping and tricking them. He trod every night then  \nThe mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where  \nWitches and wizards wander and ramble.  \nSo the foe of mankind many of evils  \nGrievous injuries, often accomplished,  \nHorrible hermit; Heort he frequented,  \nGem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen  \n(Since God did oppose him, not the throne could he touch,  \nThe light-flashing jewel, love of Him knew not).  \n’Twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the Scyldings  \nSoul-crushing sorrow. Not seldom in private  \nSat the king in his council; conference held they  \nWhat the braves should determine ’gainst terrors unlooked for.  \nAt the shrines of their idols often they promised  \nGifts and offerings, earnestly prayed they  \nThe devil from hell would help them to lighten  \nTheir people’s oppression. Such practice they used then,  \nHope of the heathen; hell they remembered  \nIn innermost spirit, God they knew not,  \nThe true God they do not know.  \nJudge of their actions, All-wielding Ruler,  \nNo praise could they give the Guardian of Heaven,  \nThe Wielder of Glory. Woe will be his who  \nThrough furious hatred his spirit shall drive to  \nThe clutch of the fire, no comfort shall look for,  \nWax no wiser; well for the man who,  \nLiving his life-days, his Lord may face  \nAnd find defence in his Father’s embrace!\n\n## HROTHGAR’S GRATITUDE.\n\nHrothgar discoursed (to the hall-building went he,\n\nHe stood by the pillar, [1](#XV.FNDEF.1) saw the steep-rising hall-roof\n\nGleaming with gold-gems, and Grendel his hand there): Hrothgar gives\nthanks for the\noverthrow of the\nmonster.\n\n“For the sight we behold now, thanks to the Wielder\n\n5\n\nEarly be offered! Much evil I bided,\n\nSnaring from Grendel: [2](#XV.FNDEF.2) God can e’er ’complish\n\nWonder on wonder, Wielder of Glory!\n\nI had given up all\nhope, when this\nbrave liegeman\ncame to our aid.\n\nBut lately I reckoned ne’er under heaven\n\nComfort to gain me for any of sorrows,\n\n10\n\nWhile the handsomest of houses horrid with bloodstain\n\nGory uptowered; grief had offfrightened [3](#XV.FNDEF.3)\n\nEach of the wise ones who weened not that ever\n\nThe folk-troop’s defences ’gainst foes they should strengthen,\n\n’Gainst sprites and monsters. Through the might of the Wielder\n\n15\n\nA doughty retainer hath a deed now accomplished\n\nWhich erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom\n\nFailed to perform. May affirm very truly\n\nWhat woman soever in all of the nations\n\nGave birth to the child, if yet she surviveth,\n\n20\n\nThat the long-ruling Lord was lavish to herward\n\nIn the birth of the bairn. Now, Beowulf dear,\n\nHereafter, Beowulf,\nthou shalt be\nmy son.\n\nMost excellent hero, I’ll love thee in spirit\n\nAs bairn of my body; bear well henceforward\n\nThe relationship new. No lack shall befall thee\n\n25\n\nOf earth-joys any I ever can give thee.\n\nFull often for lesser service I’ve given\n\nHero less hardy hoard-treasure precious,\n\nThou hast won immortal\ndistinction.\n\nTo a weaker in war-strife. By works of distinction\n\nThou hast gained for thyself now that thy glory shall flourish\n\n30\n\nForever and ever. The All-Ruler quite thee\n\nWith good from His hand as He hitherto did thee!”\n\nBeowulf replies:\nI was most happy\nto render thee this\nservice.\n\nBeowulf answered, Ecgtheow’s offspring:\n\n“That labor of glory most gladly achieved we,\n\nThe combat accomplished, unquailing we ventured\n\n35\n\nThe enemy’s grapple; I would grant it much rather\n\nThou wert able to look at the creature in person,\n\nFaint unto falling, the foe in his trappings!\n\nOn murder-bed quickly I minded to bind him,\n\nWith firm-holding fetters, that forced by my grapple\n\n40\n\nLow he should lie in life-and-death struggle\n\n’Less his body escape; I was wholly unable,\n\nI could not keep\nthe monster from\nescaping, as God\ndid not will that I\nshould.\n\nSince God did not will it, to keep him from going,\n\nNot held him that firmly, hated opposer;\n\nToo swift was the foeman. Yet safety regarding\n\n45\n\nHe suffered his hand behind him to linger,\n\nHis arm and shoulder, to act as watcher;\n\nHe left his hand\nand arm behind.\n\nNo shadow of solace the woe-begone creature\n\nFound him there nathless: the hated destroyer\n\nLiveth no longer, lashed for his evils,\n\n50\n\nBut sorrow hath seized him, in snare-meshes hath him\n\nClose in its clutches, keepeth him writhing\n\nIn baleful bonds: there banished for evil\n\nThe man shall wait for the mighty tribunal,\n\nGod will give him\nhis deserts.\n\nHow the God of glory shall give him his earnings.”\n\n55\n\nThen the soldier kept silent, son of old Ecglaf,\n\nUnferth has nothing\nmore to say,\nfor Beowulf’s actions\nspeak louder\nthan words.\n\nFrom boasting and bragging of battle-achievements,\n\nSince the princes beheld there the hand that depended\n\n’Neath the lofty hall-timbers by the might of the nobleman,\n\nEach one before him, the enemy’s fingers;\n\n60\n\nEach finger-nail strong steel most resembled,\n\nThe heathen one’s hand-spur, the hero-in-battle’s\n\nClaw most uncanny; quoth they agreeing,\n\nNo sword will\nharm the monster.\n\nThat not any excellent edges of brave ones\n\nWas willing to touch him, the terrible creature’s\n\n65\n\nBattle-hand bloody to bear away from him.\n\n[[1]](#XV.FNREF.1) B. and t.B. read ‘ staþole ,’ and translate *stood on the floor* .\n\n[[2]](#XV.FNREF.2)\n\nFor ‘snaring from Grendel,’ ‘sorrows at Grendel’s hands’ has been suggested.\nThis gives a parallel to ‘\n\nláðes .’ ‘ Grynna\n\n’ may well be gen. pl. of\n‘\n\ngyrn ,’ by a scribal slip.\n\n[[3]](#XV.FNREF.3)\n\nThe H.-So punctuation has been followed; but B. has been followed in\nunderstanding ‘\n\ngehwylcne ’ as object of ‘ wíd-scofen (hæfde)\n\n.’ Gr. construes\n‘\n\nwéa ’ as nom abs.\n\n## [XVI.](#C.XVI)\n\n## HROTHGAR LAVISHES GIFTS UPON HIS DELIVERER.\n\nHeorot is adorned\nwith hands.\n\nThen straight was ordered that Heorot inside [1](#XVI.FNDEF.1)\n\nWith hands be embellished: a host of them gathered,\n\nOf men and women, who the wassailing-building\n\nThe guest-hall begeared.

And to Beowulf granted\n\nThe prince of the Ingwins, power over both,\n\nO’er war-steeds and weapons; bade him well to enjoy them.\n\nIn so manly a manner the mighty-famed chieftain,\n\nHoard-ward of heroes, with horses and jewels\n\nWar-storms requited, that none e’er condemneth\n\nWho willeth to tell truth with full justice.\n\n[[1]](#XVI.FNREF.1) Kl. suggests ‘ hroden ’ for ‘ háten ,’ and renders: *Then quickly was*\n*Heorot adorned within, with hands bedecked* .—B. suggests ‘ gefrætwon\n\n’ instead\nof ‘\n\ngefrætwod ,’ and renders: *Then was it commanded to adorn Heorot*\n*within quickly with hands*\n\n.—The former has the advantage of affording a\nparallel to ‘\n\ngefrætwod ’: both have the disadvantage of altering the text.\n\n[[2]](#XVI.FNREF.2)\n\nThe passage 1005-1009 seems to be hopeless. One difficult point is to\nfind a subject for ‘\n\ngesacan .’ Some say ‘he’; others supply ‘each,’ *i.e., every*\n*soul-bearer … must gain the inevitable place*\n\n. The genitives in this case are\npartitive.—If ‘he’ be subj., the genitives are dependent on ‘\n\ngearwe\n\n’ (= prepared).—The\n‘he’ itself is disputed, some referring it to Grendel; but B.\ntakes it as involved in the parenthesis.\n\n## [XVII.](#C.XVII)\n\n## BANQUET ( *continued* ).—THE SCOP’S SONG OF FINN AND HNÆF.\n\nEach of Beowulf’s\ncompanions receives\na costly gift.\n\nAnd the atheling of earlmen to each of the heroes\n\nWho the ways of the waters went with Beowulf,\n\nA costly gift-token gave on the mead-bench,\n\nOffered an heirloom, and ordered that that man\n\nThe warrior killed\nby Grendel is to be\npaid for in gold.\n\nWith gold should be paid for, whom Grendel had erstwhile\n\nWickedly slaughtered, as he more of them had done\n\nHad far-seeing God and the mood of the hero\n\nThe fate not averted: the Father then governed\n\nAll of the earth-dwellers, as He ever is doing;\n\n10\n\nHence insight for all men is everywhere fittest,\n\nForethought of spirit! much he shall suffer\n\nOf lief and of loathsome who long in this present\n\nUseth the world in this woful existence.\n\nThere was music and merriment mingling together\n\nHrothgar’s scop\nrecalls events in\nthe reign of his\nlord’s father.\n\n15\n\nTouching Healfdene’s leader; the joy-wood was fingered,\n\nMeasures recited, when the singer of Hrothgar\n\nOn mead-bench should mention the merry hall-joyance\n\nOf the kinsmen of Finn, when onset surprised them:\n\nHnæf, the Danish\ngeneral, is treacherously\nattacked\nwhile staying at\nFinn’s castle.\n\n“The Half-Danish hero, Hnæf of the Scyldings,\n\n20\n\nOn the field of the Frisians was fated to perish.\n\nSure Hildeburg needed not mention approving\n\nThe faith of the Jutemen: though blameless entirely,\n\nQueen Hildeburg\nis not only wife of\nFinn, but a kinswoman\nof the murdered\nHnæf.\n\nWhen shields were shivered she was shorn of her darlings,\n\nOf bairns and brothers: they bent to their fate\n\n25\n\nWith war-spear wounded; woe was that woman.\n\nNot causeless lamented the daughter of Hoce\n\nThe decree of the Wielder when morning-light came and\n\nShe was able ’neath heaven to behold the destruction\n\nOf brothers and bairns, where the brightest of earth-joys\n\nFinn’s force is mostly\nslain.\n\n30\n\nShe had cherished in life.

      "source": "Chaucer - The Canterbury Tales",
      "text": "The Canterbury Tales is framed as a pilgrimage from London (via Southwark) to Canterbury in April, amid spring's renewal. The narrator (Chaucer) joins 29 pilgrims at the Tabard Inn, hosted by Harry Bailey, who proposes a storytelling contest for supper stakes. The pilgrimage aims to visit Thomas Becket's shrine; tales reflect diverse social classes, virtues, vices, and themes like chivalry, love, religion, and morality. The General Prologue introduces pilgrims; subsequent tales (e.g., Knight's, Wife of Bath's, Clerk's) explore narratives, with interruptions and debates.\n\n### Merged Summary of Segments\nThe provided segments span the General Prologue (pilgrim introductions), excerpts from tales like the Knight's, Miller's, Monk's, Shipman's, and others, plus allegorical works like *The Flower and the Leaf* and *The House of Fame*.

      "name": "Metamorphoses Book 1 (Creation)",
      "source": "Ovid - Metamorphoses",
      "text": "Ovid's *Metamorphoses* chronicles transformations across cosmic, human, and divine realms, emphasizing change as a fundamental principle. The narrative begins with cosmic order emerging from chaos and progresses through human ages, divine interventions, and specific myths of metamorphosis. Below is a merged summary of the provided segments, organized by fable for clarity. Each entry includes key events, transformations, and explanations where noted.\n\n#### Book 1: General Structure\n- **Argument**: Ovid invokes the gods to aid his retelling of transformations from world's beginning to present, focusing on forms changed into new bodies.\n\n#### Fable I: Ordering Chaos\n- **Summary**: Chaos, a rude, inert mass of discordant atoms (no distinct elements, obstructing each other with cold vs. hot, moist vs. dry), is separated by God/Nature. Earth, sea, and heaven divide; elements harmonize in places (fire/heaven highest, air next, earth weightiest, waters lowest). Universe forms a globe with seas, rivers, plains, valleys, mountains, zones (temperate, hot, cold), and winds assigned regions.\n- **No transformations**: Emphasis on creation and placement.\n\n#### Fable II: Formation of Universe and Humanity\n- **Summary**: God shapes globe, adds seas/winds, springs/rivers, plains/woods/mountains/zones. Air holds vapors/clouds/thunder/lightning/winds; stars emerge in heavens. Animals populate (fish in waters, beasts on earth, birds in air). Prometheus molds man from earth/water, animated by Minerva; man looks upward, ruling others.\n- **Transformation**: Rude earth becomes human form.\n\n#### Fable III: Golden Age\n- **Summary**: First age of innocence; no laws, punishment, or crime. Earth yields food freely (fruits, acorns, grain, milk, nectar, honey); eternal spring with gentle zephyrs.\n- **No transformations**: Ideal harmony.\n\n#### Fable IV: Silver, Brazen, and Iron Ages\n- **Summary**: Saturn exiled, Jupiter rules; Silver Age introduces seasons, houses, agriculture (oxen/yokes). Brazen Age brings fiercer wars, no impiety. Iron Age peaks wickedness: fraud, treachery, violence, acquisition; sailing, boundaries, mining, war, family crimes; Astraea (justice) flees last.\n- **No transformations**: Moral decline over ages.\n\n#### Fable V: Giants' Revolt\n- **Summary**: Giants heap mountains to assault heaven; Jupiter hurls lightning, scatters them. Earth animates their blood into fierce, violent men.\n- **Transformation**: Giants' blood becomes cruel human generation.\n\n#### Fable VI: Decision to Destroy Humanity\n- **Summary**: Jupiter, recalling Lycaon's polluted banquet, convenes gods in heavenly palace (Milky Way path). He condemns mortals' crimes, resolves to cut off race.\n- **No transformations**: Setup for flood (implied).\n\n#### Fable of Syrinx (Pan and Syrinx)\n- **Summary**: Naiad Syrinx flees lustful Pan (crowned with pine), prays to waters for change at Ladon river; becomes reeds. Pan, sighing, fashions panpipes from them.\n- **Transformation**: Syrinx into reeds (syrinx/panpipe).\n- **Explanation**: Egyptian origin; Pan as nature deity; possibly one of multiple Pans; instrument from Ladon reeds.\n\n#### Fable of Coronis and Apollo\n- **Summary**: Apollo, jealous via raven/informant, shoots Coronis; she dies cursing, bathed in blood. Apollo regrets, fails revival arts; snatches unborn Asclepius from pyre, entrusts to Chiron; forbids white ravens. Coronis possibly linked to crow transformation.\n- **Transformation**: None direct; raven from white to black for loquacity; Coronis dies (egg/bird link speculated).\n- **Explanation**: No historical basis; possible Cecropian era; Asclepius from crow egg/serpent form.\n\n#### Fable X: Ocyrrhoë's Transformation\n- **Summary**: Chiron’s daughter Ocyrrhoë, prophetic, foretells Asclepius' fate (revival/death/revival), Chiron’s wound/death. Gods punish; she changes mid-sentence to mare (Enippe), desires plains/grass.\n- **Transformation**: Ocyrrhoë to mare (Enippe); partial (retains some human traits like father's dual form).\n- **Explanation**: None provided.\n\n#### Fable of Bacchus' Abduction (Acetes' Account)\n- **Summary**: Pirates (led by Lycabas) abduct sleeping Bacchus (mistaken for boy); Acetes resists. Bacchus awakens, demands Naxos; crew deceives, sails elsewhere. Ship stalls; ivy/clusters impede; Bacchus reveals self with tigers/lynxes/panthers, lance. Crew transforms: Medon to fish, others to sea creatures (fins, tails, scales); Acetes escapes to Dia, performs rites.\n- **Transformations**: Crew to fish/sea monsters; ivy on oars/sails.\n- **No explanation**: Direct divine vengeance.\n\n#### Fable of Perseus and Atlas (Integrated with Danaë Context)\n- **Summary**: Jupiter seduces Danaë as gold; she bears Perseus. Acrisius exposes them; rescued by Polydectes. Perseus uses Medusa's head (gifted/gorgon face) to petrify foes; slays Medusa, uses head. Kills Atlas (who guarded apples); Atlas becomes mountain (beard/hair/shoulders/head as ridges/woods/stones/summit), holding sky.\n- **Transformations**: Atlas to mountain; enemies to stone via Medusa.\n- **Explanations (Multiple Theories)**:\n  - Danaë: Tower imprisonment bypassed by gold; exposure in boat; Seriphus refuge.\n  - Gorgons: Warriors near Lake Tritonis; Medusa ruled, killed by Perseus; head preserved for display.\n  - Alternative: Wealthy women with shared \"eye\" (minister); Perseus seizes for statue.\n  - Beauty impression turning viewers to statues.\n  - Phoenician voyage; \"Perseus\" as horseman, Pegasus as bridled horse.\n  - Libyan \"gorgon\" animal (sheep-like, breath-killing gaze).\n  - Gorgades islands (possibly Cape Verde); Atlas death names mountain; apples as gold mines/sheep/fruits.\n\n#### General Notes on Transformations\n- **Thematic Density**: Changes often punish hubris, lust, or crime (e.g., humans to animals/constellations/stones); gods intervene for order/morality.\n- **Explanatory Variations**: Myths blend cosmology (chaos to order), ages of man (decline), and etymological/historical bases (e.g., animals as symbols, places as events)."

      "text": "Fable XII: Apollo and Daphne (Book I)\n- **Origin of Love**: Daphne, daughter of Peneus, is Cupid's assigned target for Apollo (Phoebus) out of vengeance. Apollo, proud after slaying the Python, mocks Cupid's \"wanton\" ways; Cupid retorts that his arrow will wound Apollo, while his own repels glory.\n- **Arrows' Effects**: Cupid's golden arrow (excites desire) strikes Daphne; leaden arrow (repels) strikes Apollo. Daphne flees love, delights in woods, hunting, virginity; rivals virgin Phoebe; wears unbound hair, rejects suitors, unaware of marriage.\n- **Daphne's Resistance**: Father Peneus urges marriage/children; Daphne abhorring nuptials, blushes modestly, clings to father begging perpetual virginity (granted, like Diana's).\n- **Apollo's Pursuit**: Beauty hinders Daphne's desire for virginity; Apollo falls in love, covets her, hopes for alliance via oracles. Passion burns him like fire on stubble/torches; admires her unbound hair, starry eyes, lips, naked arms/shoulders (imagines hidden parts more beautiful).\n- **Chase Description**: Daphne flees swifter than wind; Apollo calls her back, claiming no enmity, compares pursuit to lamb-wolf, deer-lion, dove-eagle; fears her injury on rugged paths, offers to slow pace; reveals identity as Apollo (Delphian lands, Jupiter's son, oracle-giver, healer; wounded by Cupid's arrow). Love incurable by herbs.\n- **Flight and Transformation**: Winds expose Daphne's beauty (fluttering garments, spreading locks); Apollo hastens, pursues like greyhound-hare; aided by love's wings, nears her, breathes on hair. Daphne exhausted, pale, prays to Peneus/rivers/Earth for aid to destroy transforming form.\n- **Daphne's Change**: Torpor seizes limbs; breasts bark-covered, hair to leaves, arms to branches, feet to roots; retains elegance. Apollo touches throbbing breast, embraces branches, kisses wood (shrinks from kisses).\n- **Laurel's Role**: Daphne cannot be wife, becomes tree (laurel); Apollo claims it for hair, lyre, quiver; presented to Latian chieftains, triumphs, Capitol processions, Augustus' doors, guards oak; eternal foliage like his youth. Laurel nods assent with boughs."

      "text": "Pyramus and Thisbe, the one the most beauteous of youths, [18](#note4_18) the other preferred before *all* the damsels that the East contained, lived in adjoining houses; where Semiramis is said to have surrounded her lofty city[19](#note4_19) with walls of brick. [20](#note4_20) The nearness caused their first acquaintance, and their first advances *in love*; with time their affection increased. They would have united themselves, too, by the tie of marriage, but their fathers forbade it. A thing which they could not forbid, they were both inflamed, with minds equally captivated. There is no one acquainted with it; by nods and signs, they hold converse. And the more the fire is smothered, the more, when *so* smothered, does it burn. The party-wall, common to the two houses, was cleft by a small chink, which it had got formerly, when it was built. This defect, remarked by no one for so many ages, you lovers (what does not love perceive?) first found one, and you made it a passage for your voices, and the accents of love used to pass through it in safety, with the gentlest murmur. Oftentimes, after they had taken their stations, Thisbe on one side, *and* Pyramus on the other, and the breath of their mouths had been *mutually* caught by turns, they used to say, ‘Envious wall, why dost thou stand in the way of lovers? what great matter were it, for thee to suffer us to be joined with our entire bodies? Or if that is too much, that, at least, thou shouldst open, for the exchange of kisses. Nor are we ungrateful; we confess that we are indebted to thee, that a passage has been given for our words to our loving ears.’ Having said this much, in vain, on their respective sides, about night they said, ‘Farewell’; and gave those kisses each on their own side, which did not reach the other side.\n\n“The following morning had removed the fires of the night, and the Sun, with its rays, had dried the grass wet with rime, *when* they met together at the wonted spot. Then, first complaining much in low murmurs, they determine, in the silent night, to try to deceive their keepers, and to steal out of doors; and when they have left the house, to quit the buildings of the city as well: but that they may not have to wander, roaming in the open fields, to meet at the tomb of Ninus,[21](#note4_21) and to conceal themselves beneath the shade of a tree. There was there a lofty mulberry tree, very full of snow-white fruit, quite close to a cold spring. The arrangement suits them; and the light, seeming to depart *but* slowly, is buried in the waters, and from the same waters the night arises. The clever Thisbe, turning the hinge, gets out in the dark, and deceives her *attendants*, and, having covered her face, arrives at the tomb, and sits down under the tree agreed upon; love made her bold. Lo! a lioness approaches, having her foaming jaws besmeared with the recent slaughter of oxen, about to quench her thirst with the water of the neighboring spring. The Babylonian Thisbe sees her at a distance, by the rays of the moon, and with a trembling foot she flies to a dark cave; and, while she flies, her veil falling from her back, she leaves it behind. When the savage lioness has quenched her thirst with plenteous water, as she is returning into the woods, she tears the thin covering, found by chance without Thisbe herself, with her blood-stained mouth.\n\n“Pyramus, going out later *than Thisbe*, saw the evident footmarks of a wild beast, in the deep dust, and grew pale all over his face. But, as soon as he found her veil, as well, dyed with blood, he said: ‘One night will be the ruin of two lovers, of whom she was the most deserving of a long life. My soul is guilty; ’tis I that have destroyed thee, much to be lamented; who bade thee to come by night to places full of terror, and came not hither first. O, whatever lions are lurking beneath this rock, tear my body in pieces, and devour my accursed entrails with ruthless jaws. But it is the part of a coward to wish for death.’ He takes up the veil of Thisbe, and he takes it with himself to the shade of the tree agreed on, and, after he has bestowed tears on the well-known garment, he gives kisses *to the same*, and he says, ‘Receive, now, a draught of my blood as well!’ and then plunges the sword, with which he is girt, into his bowels; and without delay, as he is dying, he draws it out of the warm wound. As he falls on his back upon the ground, the blood spurts forth on high, not otherwise than as when a pipe is burst on the lead decaying,[22](#note4_22) and shoots out afar the liquid water from the hissing flaw, and cleaves the air with its jet. The fruit of the tree, by the sprinkling of the blood, are changed to a dark tint, and the root, soaked with the gore, tints the hanging mulberries with a purple hue. Behold! not yet having banished her fear, *Thisbe* returns, that she may not disappoint her lover, and seeks for the youth both with her eyes and her affection, and longs to tell him how great dangers she has escaped. And when she observes the spot, and the altered appearance of the tree, she doubts if it is the same, so uncertain does the color of the fruit make her. While she is in doubt, she sees palpitating limbs throbbing upon the bloody ground; she draws back her foot, and having her face paler than box-wood,[23](#note4_23) she shudders like the sea, which trembles[24](#note4_24) when its surface is skimmed by a gentle breeze. But, after pausing a time, she had recognized her own lover, she smote her arms, undeserving *of such usage*, and tearing her hair, and embracing the much-loved body, she filled the gashes with her tears, and mingled her *tokens of* sorrow with his blood; and imprinting kisses on his cold features, she exclaimed, ‘Pyramus! what disaster has taken thee away from me? Pyramus! answer me; ’tis thy own Thisbe, dearest, that calls thee; hear me, and raise thy prostrate features.’\n\n“At the name of Thisbe, Pyramus raised his eyes, now heavy with death, and, after he had seen her, he closed them again. After she had perceived her own garment, and beheld, too, the ivory *sheath* [25](#note4_25) without its sword, she said, ‘’Tis thy own hand, and love, that has destroyed thee, ill-fated *youth*! I, too, have a hand bold *enough* for this one purpose; I have love as well; this shall give me strength for the wound. I will follow thee in thy death, and I shall be called the most unhappy cause and companion of thy fate, and thou who, alas! couldst be torn from me by death alone, shalt not be able, even by death, to be torn from me. And you, O most wretched parents of mine and his, be but prevailed upon,"

      "source": "Bulfinch - Mythology",
      "text": "Orpheus, son of Apollo and the Muse Calliope, was the greatest musician of antiquity, whose lyre and song charmed wild beasts, moved trees and rocks to follow him, and softened even the hearts of stones and rivers. He married Eurydice, a beautiful nymph, whose happiness was short-lived: pursued by the shepherd Aristaeus (son of Apollo), she fled, stepped on a serpent in the grass, and died from its bite. Devastated, Orpheus resolved to descend to Hades to retrieve her.\n\n- **Descent to Hades**: Orpheus journeyed to the banks of the Styx, persuading Charon (the ferryman) to transport him across with his music. He passed the gates of Hades, taming Cerberus (the three-headed dog) with his lyre, soothing the Furies, and moving the shades of the dead. Before Pluto and Proserpine (king and queen of the underworld), he sang lamentations so poignant that the ghosts wept—Tantalus paused his thirst, Sisyphus rested his rock, Ixion's wheel halted, and the Danaids ceased their sieve-drawing. Pluto relented, allowing Orpheus to lead Eurydice back to the upper world on condition: he must not look back at her until they reached the surface, or she would be lost forever.\n\n- **Ascent and Tragic Failure**: They ascended in silence, Orpheus leading by the hand. Near the exit, doubt overwhelmed him; he glanced back, seeing Eurydice vanish into shades. She cried \"Farewell!\" as she fell back. Orpheus wept, begged to return, but Charon refused. He lingered seven days without food or sleep, then wandered the earth in grief, shunning men and women.\n\n- **Orpheus's Death and Legacy**: Repulsed by Thracian maidens' advances, they stoned him (missiles harmless at first due to his music), but their screams drowned it; he was torn limb from limb. His head and lyre floated down the Hebrus River, still singing, to Lesbos, where Muses buried his body at Libethra (nightingales sang sweeter there). Jupiter placed his lyre in the stars as Lyra. Allegorically, it symbolizes the soul's descent into the body and return to spirit; in art, Orpheus is depicted with lyre amid animals or turning to Eurydice.\n\n- **Subsequent Wandering and Reunion**: In death, Orpheus's shade returned to Hades, embracing Eurydice; they roam Elysian fields together, him leading or her, without penalty for glances.\n\n- **Poetic Allusions**:\n  - Shakespeare (*Henry VIII*): \"Orpheus with his lute made trees... Bow themselves when he did sing... Killing care and grief of heart Fall asleep, or hearing, die.\"\n  - Milton (*L’Allegro*): \"Orpheus could lead the savage race; And trees uprooted left their place, Sequacious of the lyre.\"\n  - Milton (*Lycidas*): References his songs moving oaks and rills.\n  - Tennyson (*In Memoriam*): \"Orpheus with his lute made trees... Bow unto his mystery: And the leaves of the forest tree Fell into the audient sea.\"\n  - Dramatized in Gluck's opera *Orfeo ed Euridice*.\n\n- **Related Figures and Myths**:\n  - **Aristæus**: Apollo's son, bee-keeper; bees died, consulted Sibyl, then Proteus (river-god), who gave rites to restore them.\n  - **Amphion**: Jupiter's son, twin with Zethus; musician who built Thebes' walls by lyre-moving stones.\n  - **Linus**: Hercules' music instructor; killed by Hercules in anger, pursued by Furies.\n  - **Thamyris**: Blind Thracian bard; boasted over Muses, lost sight and art (Milton alludes in *Paradise Lost*, Book III).\n  - **Marsyas**: Satyr finding Athena's flute; challenged Apollo, lost, flayed alive.\n  - **Melampus**: Seer interpreting animals; cured Proetus' daughters' madness by inducing it first.\n  - **Musæus**: Semi-mythical; son of Orpheus (tradition); writes sacred poems/oracles; Milton couples with Orpheus in *Il Penseroso*.\n  - **Arion**: Musician; favored at Periander's court; wins Sicily prize; robbed by sailors, sings death song, rescued by dolphin (lands safely; monument erected). Spenser: on dolphin with Neptune/Amphitrite. Byron: sailor-music allusion. Ibycus (poet, adventures); Scylla (pre-Circe myth); Osiris (Egyptian: killed by Typhon, body scattered, Isis reassembled; Apis bull worshipped); Baldur (Norse: burned, Loki punished with serpent venom); Tristram/Isoude (romance: poisoned wound, love potion, quests); Galahad (Holy Grail quest, saw vessel ascend); Owain (lion adventure, rescued maiden); Manawyddan/Pryderi (Welsh: mist curse, shoe-making, wheat stolen by mice); Orlando/Roland (slayed Ferragus giant, won Durindana sword); Mandricardo (won Hector's arms); Angelica/Medoro (married shepherd after battles)."

      "text": "# Gylfaginning\n\n## HERE BEGINS\n THE BEGUILING OF GYLFI\n\nI. King Gylfi ruled the land that men now call Sweden. It is told of him that he gave to a wandering woman, in return for her merry-making, a plow-land in his realm, as much as four oxen might turn up in a day and a night. But this woman was of the kin of the Æsir; she was named Gefjun. She took from the north, out of Jötunheim, four oxen which were the soils of a certain giant and, herself, and set them before the plow. And the plow cut so wide and so deep that it loosened up the land; and the oxen drew the land out into the sea and to the westward, and stopped in a certain sound. There Gefjun set the land, and gave it a name, calling it Selund. And from that time on, the spot whence the land had been torn up is water: it is now called the Lögr in Sweden; and bays lie in that lake even as the headlands in Selund. Thus says Bragi, the ancient skald:\n\nGefjun drew from Gylfi | gladly the wave-trove's free-hold,\n\n Till from the running beasts | sweat reeked, to Denmark's increase;\n\n The oxen bore, moreover, | eight eyes, gleaming brow-lights,\n\n O'er the field's wide: booty, | and four heads in their plowing.\n\nII. King Gylfi was a wise man and skilled in magic; he was much troubled that the Æsir-people were so cunning that all things went according to their will. He pondered whether this might proceed from their own nature, or\n\n{p. 14}\n\nwhether the divine powers which they worshipped might ordain such things. He set out on his way to Ásgard, going secretly, and- clad himself in the likeness of an old man, with which he dissembled. But the Æsir were wiser in this matter, having second sight; and they saw his journeying before ever he came, and prepared against him deceptions of the eye. When he came into the town, he saw there a hall so high that he could not easily make out the top of it: its thatching was laid with golden shields after the fashion of a shingled roof. So also says Thjódólfr of Hvin, that Valhall was thatched with shields:\n\nOn their backs they let beam, | sore battered with stones,\n\n Odin's hall-shingles, | the shrewd sea-farers.\n\nIn the hall-doorway Gylfi saw a man juggling with anlaces, having seven in the air at one time. This man asked of him his name. He called himself Gangleri, and said he had come by the paths of the serpent, and prayed for lodging for the night, asking: \"Who owns the hall?\" The other replied that it was their king; \"and I will attend thee to see him; then shalt thou thyself ask him concerning his; name;\" and the man wheeled about before him into the hall, and he went after, and straightway the door closed itself on his heels. There he saw a great room and much people, some with games, some drinking; and some had weapons and were fighting. Then he looked about him, and thought unbelievable many things which he saw; and he said:\n\nAll the gateways | ere one goes out\n\n     Should one scan:\n\n For 't is uncertain | where sit the unfriendly\n\n     On the bench before thee.\n\n{p. 15}\n\nHe saw three high-seats, each above the other, and three men sat thereon,-one on each. And he asked what might be the name of those lords. He who had conducted him in answered that the one who, sat on the nethermost high-seat was a king, \"and his name is Hárr;[1] but the next is named Janhárr;[2] and he who is uppermost is called Thridi.\"[3] Then Hárr asked the newcomer whether his errand were more than for the meat and drink which were always at his command, as for every one there in the Hall of the High One. He answered that he first desired to learn whether there were any wise man there within. Hárr said, that he should not escape whole from thence unless he were wiser.\n\nAnd stand thou forth | who speirest;\n\n Who answers, | he shall sit.\n\nIII. Gangleri began his questioning thus: \"Who is foremost, or oldest, of all the gods?\" Hárr answered: \"He is called in our speech Allfather, but in the Elder Ásgard he had twelve names: one is Allfather; the second is Lord, or Lord of Hosts; the third is Nikarr, or Spear-Lord; the fourth is Nikudr, or Striker; the fifth is Knower of Many Things; the sixth, Fulfiller of Wishes; the seventh, Far-Speaking One; the eighth, The Shaker, or He that Putteth the Armies to Flight; the ninth, The Burner; the tenth, The Destroyer; the eleventh, The Protector; the twelfth, Gelding.\"\n\nThen asked Gangleri: \"Where is this god, or what power hath he, or what hath he wrought that is a glorious deed?\" Hárr made answer: \"He lives throughout all ages and governs all his realm, and directs all things, great\n\n[1. High.\n\n2. Equally High.\n\n3. Third.]\n\n{p. 16}\n\nand small.\" Then said Jafnhárr: \"He fashioned heaven and earth and air, and all things which are in them.\" Then. spake Thridi: \"The greatest of all is this: that he made man, and gave him the spirit, which shall live and never perish, though the flesh-frame rot to mould, or burn to ashes; and all men shall live, such as are just in action, and be with himself in the place called Gimlé. But evil men go to Hel and thence down to the Misty Hel; and that is down in the ninth world.\" Then said Gangleri: \"What did he before heaven and earth were made?\" And Hárr answered: \"He was then with the Rime-Giants.\"\n\nIV. Gangleri said: \"What was the beginning, or how began it, or what was before it?\" Hárr answered: \"As is told in *Völuspá* :\n\nErst was the age | when nothing was:\n\n Nor sand nor sea, | nor chilling stream-waves;\n\n Earth was not found, | nor Ether-Heaven,--\n\n A Yawning Gap, | but grass was none.\"\n\nThen said Jafnhárr: \"It was many ages before the earth was shaped that the Mist-World was made; and midmost within it lies the well that is called Hvergelmir, from which spring the rivers called Svöl, Gunnthrá, Fjörm, Fimbulthul, Slídr and Hríd, Sylgr and Ylgr, Víd, Leiptr; Gjöll is hard by Hel-gates.\" And Thridi said: \"Yet first was the world in the southern region, which was named Múspell; it is light and hot; that region is glowing and burning, and impassable to such as are outlanders and have not their holdings there. He who sits there at the land's-end, to defend the land, is called Surtr; he brandishes a flaming\n\n{p. 17}\n\nsword, and at the end of the world he shall go forth and harry, and overcome all the gods, and burn all the world with fire; thus is said in *Völuspá* :\n\nSurtr fares from the south | with switch-eating flame,--\n\n On his sword shimmers | the sun of the War-Gods;\n\n The rock-crags crash; | the fiends are reeling;\n\n Heroes tread Hel-way; | Heaven is cloven.\"\n\nV. Gangleri asked: \"How were things wrought, ere the races were and the tribes of men increased?\" Then said Hárr: \"The streams called Ice-waves, those which were so long come from the fountain-heads that the yeasty venom upon them had hardened like the slag that runs out of the fire,--these then became ice; and when the ice halted and ceased to run, then it froze over above. But the drizzling rain that rose from the venom congealed to rime, and the rime increased, frost over frost, each over the other, even into Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void.\" Then spake Jafnhárr: \"Ginnungagap, which faced toward the northern quarter, became filled with heaviness, and masses of ice and rime, and from within, drizzling rain and gusts; but the southern part of the Yawning Void was lighted by those sparks and glowing masses which flew out of Múspellheim.\" And Thridi said: \"Just as cold arose out of Niflheim, and all terrible things, so also all that looked toward Múspellheim became hot and glowing; but Ginnungagap was as mild as windless air, and when the breath of heat met the rime, so that it melted and dripped, life was quickened from the yeast-drops, by the power of that which sent the heat, and became a man's form. And that man is named Ymir, but the Rime-Giants call him Aurgelimir;\n\n{p. 18}\n\nand thence are come the races of the Rime-Giants, as it says in *Völuspá the Less* :\n\nAll the witches | spring from Witolf,\n\n All the warlocks | are of Willharm,\n\n And the spell-singers | spring from Swarthead;\n\n All the ogres | of Ymir come.\n\nBut concerning this says Vafthrúdnir the giant:\n\nOut of the Ice-waves | issued venom-drops,\n\n Waxing until | a giant was;\n\n Thence are our kindred | come all together,--\n\n So it is | they are savage forever.\"\n\nThen said Gangleri: \"How did the races grow thence, or after what fashion was it brought to pass that more men came into being? Or do ye hold him God, of whom ye but now spake?\" And Jafnhárr answered: \"By no means do we acknowledge him God; he was evil and all his kindred: we call them Rime-Giants. Now it is said that when he slept, a sweat came upon him, and there grew under his left hand a man and a woman, and one of his feet begat a son with the other; and thus the races are come; these are the Rime-Giants. The old Rime-Giant, him we call Ymir.\"\n\nVI. Then said Gangleri: \"Where dwelt Ymir, or wherein did he find sustenance?\" Hárr answered: \"Straightway after the rime dripped, there sprang from it the cow called Audumla; four streams of milk ran from her udders, and she nourished Ymir.\" Then asked Gangleri: \"Wherewithal was the cow nourished?\" And Hárr made answer:\n\n{p. 19}\n\n\"She licked the ice-blocks, which were salty; and the first day that she licked the blocks, there came forth from the blocks in the evening a man's hair; the second day, a man's head; the third day the whole man was there. He is named Búri: he was fair of feature, great and mighty. He begat a son called Borr, who wedded the woman named Bestla, daughter of Bölthorn the giant; and they had three sons: one was Odin, the second Vili, the third Vé. And this is my belief, that he, Odin, with his brothers, must be ruler of heaven and earth; we hold that he must be so called; so is that man called whom we know to be mightiest and most worthy of honor, and ye do well to let him be so called.\"\n\nVII. Then said Gangleri: \"What covenant was between them, or which was the stronger?\" And Hárr answered: \"The sons of Borr slew Ymir the giant; lo, where he fell there gushed forth so much blood out of his wounds that with it they drowned all the race of the Rime-Giants, save that one, whom giants call Bergelmir, escaped with his household; he went upon his ship,[1] and his wife with him, and they were safe there. And from them are come the races of the Rime-Giants, as is said here:\n\nUntold ages | ere earth was shapen,\n\n     Then was Bergelmir born;\n\n That first I recall, | how the famous wise giant\n\n     On the deck of the ship was laid down.\"\n\nVIII. Then said Gangleri: \"What was done then by Borr's sons, if thou believe that they be gods?\" Hárr replied: \"In this matter there is no little to be said. They took\n\n[1. Literally, mill-bench or mortar.]\n\n{p. 20}\n\nYmir and bore him into the middle of the Yawning Void, and made of him the earth: of his blood the sea and the waters; the land was made of his flesh, and the crags of his bones; gravel and stones they fashioned from his teeth and his grinders and from those bones that were broken.\" And Jafnhárr said: \"Of the blood, which ran and welled forth freely out of his wounds, they made the sea, when they had formed and made firm the earth together, and laid the sea in a ring round. about her; and it may well seem a hard thing to most men to cross over it.\" Then said Thridi: \"They took his skull also, and made of it the heaven, and set it up over the earth with four corners; and under each corner they set a dwarf: the names of these are East, West, North, and South. Then they took the glowing embers and sparks that burst forth and had been cast out of Múspellheim, and set them in the midst of the Yawning Void, in the heaven, both above and below, to illumine heaven and earth. They assigned places to all fires: to some in heaven, some wandered free under the heavens; nevertheless, to these also they gave a place, and shaped them courses. It is said in old \"songs, that from these the days were reckoned, and the tale of years told, as is said in *Völuspá* :\n\nThe sun knew not | where she had housing;\n\n The moon knew not | what Might he had;\n\n The stars knew not | where stood their places.\n\n Thus was it ere | the earth was fashioned.\"\n\nThen said Gangleri: These are great tidings which I now hear; that is a wondrous great piece of craftsmanship, and cunningly made. How was the earth contrived?\" And Hárr answered: \"She is ring-shaped without, and round about\n\n{p. 21}\n\nher without lieth the deep sea; and along the strand of that sea they gave lands to the races of giants for habitation. But on the inner earth they made a citadel round about the world against the hostility of the giants, and for their citadel they raised up the brows of Ymir the giant, and called that place Midgard. They took also his brain and cast it in the air, and made from it the clouds, as is here said:\n\nOf Ymir's flesh | the earth was fashioned,\n\n     And of his sweat the sea;\n\n Crags of his bones, | trees of his hair,\n\n     And of his skull the sky.\n\n Then of his brows | the blithe gods made\n\n     Midgard for sons of men;\n\n And of his brain | the bitter-mooded\n\n     Clouds were all created.\"\n\nIX. Then said Gangleri: \"Much indeed they had accomplished then, when earth and heaven were made, and the sun and the constellations of heaven were fixed, and division was made of days; now whence come the men that people the world?\" And Hárr answered: 'When the sons of Borr were walking along the sea-strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight. They gave them clothing and names: the male was called Askr, and the female Embla, and of them was mankind begotten, which received a dwelling-place under Midgard. Next they made for themselves in the middle of the world a city which is called Ásgard; men call it Troy. There dwelt the gods and their kindred; and many tidings and tales of it have\n\n{p. 22}\n\ncome to pass both on earth and aloft. There is one abode called Hlidskjálf, and when Allfather sat in the high-seat there, he looked out over the whole world and saw every man's acts, and knew all things which he saw. His wife was called Frigg daughter of Fjörgvinn; and of their blood is come that kindred which we call the races of the Æsir, that have peopled the Elder Ásgard, and those kingdoms which pertain to it; and that is a divine race. For this reason must he be called Allfather: because he is father of all the gods and of men, and of all that was fulfilled of him and of his might. The Earth was his daughter and his wife; on her he begot the first son, which is Ása-Thor: strength and prowess attend him, wherewith he overcometh all living things.\n\nX. \"Nörfi or Narfi is the name of a giant that dwelt in Jötunheim: he had a daughter called Night; she was swarthy and dark, as befitted her race. She was given to the man named Naglfari; their son was Audr. Afterward she was wedded to him that was called Annarr; Jörd[1] was their daughter. Last of all Dayspring had her, and he was of the race of the Æsir; their son was Day: he was radiant and fair after his father. Then Allfather took Night, and Day her son, and gave to them two horses and two chariots, and sent them up into the heavens, to ride round about the earth every two half-days. Night rides before with the horse named Frosty-Mane, and on each morning he bedews the earth with the foam from his bit. The horse that Day has is called Sheen-Mane, and he illumines all the air and the earth from his mane.\"\n\n[1. Earth.]\n\n{p. 23}\n\nXI. Then said Gangleri: \"How does he govern the course of the sun or of the moon?\" Hárr answered: \"A certain man was named Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and comely that he called his son Moon, and his daughter Sun, and wedded her to the man called Glenr. But the gods were incensed at that insolence, and took the brother and sister, and set them up in the heavens; they caused Sun to drive those horses that drew the chariot of the sun, which the gods had fashioned, for the world's illumination, from that glowing stuff which flew out of Múspellheim. Those horses are called thus: Early-Wake and All-Strong; and under the shoulders of the horses the gods set two wind-bags to cool them, but in some records that is called 'iron-coolness.' Moon steers the course of the moon, and determines its waxing and waning. He took from the earth-two children, called Bil and Hjúki, they that went from the well called Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the cask called Sægr, and the pole Simul. Their father is named Vidfinnr. These children follow Moon, as may be seen from the earth.\"\n\nXII. Then said Gangleri: \"The sun fares swiftly, and almost as if she were afraid: she could not hasten her course any the more if she feared her destruction.\" Then Hárr made answer: \"It is no marvel that she hastens furiously: close cometh he that seeks her, and she has no escape save to run away.\" Then said Gangleri: \"Who is he that causes her this disquiet?\" Hárr replied: \"It is two wolves; and he that runs after her is called Skoll; she fears him, and he shall take her. But he that leaps before her is called Hati Hródvitnisson. He is eager to seize the moon; and so it must be.\" Then said Gangleri: \"What is the race of the\n\n{p. 24}\n\nwolves?\" Hárr answered: \"A witch dwells to the east of Midgard, in the forest called Ironwood: in that wood dwell the troll-women, who are known as Ironwood-Women. The old witch bears many giants for sons, and all in the shape of wolves; and from this source are these wolves sprung. The saying runs thus: from this race shall come one that shall be mightiest of all, he that is named Moon-Hound; he shall be filled with the flesh of all those men that die, and he shall swallow the moon, and sprinkle with blood the heavens and all the lair; thereof-shall the sun lose her shining, and the winds in that day shall be unquiet and roar on every side. So it says in *Völuspá* :\n\nEastward dwells the Old One | in Ironwood,\n\n And there gives birth | to Fenrir's brethren;\n\n There shall spring of them all | a certain one,\n\n The moon's taker | in troll's likeness.\n\nHe is filled with flesh | of fey men.\n\n Reddens the gods' seats | with ruddy blood-gouts;\n\n Swart becomes sunshine | in summers after,\n\n The weather all shifty. | Wit ye yet, or what?\"\n\nXIII. Then said Gangleri: \"The sun fares swiftly, and almost as if she were afraid: she could not hasten her course any the more if she feared her destruction.\" Then Hárr made answer: \"It is no marvel that she hastens furiously: close cometh he that seeks her, and she has no escape save to run away.\" Then said Gangleri: \"Who is he that causes her this disquiet?\" Hárr replied: \"It is two wolves; and he that runs after her is called Skoll; she fears him, and he shall take her.

      "text": "King Arthur establishes a Round Table to ensure equality among knights, with no preference for one over another. He invites barons and knights to swear oaths of loyalty to him and his heirs, to maintain laws, justice, fellowship, and mutual aid. The table is furnished with seats, hiding places, a royal siege and throne in the center, and a sword placed where the king sits. After the oaths are sworn, Arthur appoints Sir Gawain as the first knight, chief of the Round Table, keeper of the sword, and first in sitting, rising, speaking, service, and obedience (repeated emphatically in the source text to emphasize his primacy).\n\nIn a separate account, Arthur consults Merlin about marriage, expressing love for Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance of Camelgard, who possesses the Round Table inherited from Arthur's father Uther. Merlin warns of future misery but advises the match. Arthur requests Guinevere's hand, referencing his prior rescue of Leodegrance with Kings Ban and Bors from King Ryence. Leodegrance agrees, sending Guinevere and the Round Table with 100 knights to Arthur.\n\nThe journey to Camelot involves royal travel by water and land, with sports, pastimes, minstrelsy, and tales. Sir Lancelot, newly at court, excels in games, wins praise for grace and hardihood, and captivates Guinevere with his tales and songs, especially at evening tents.\n\nUpon arrival, Arthur hosts grand celebrations. He assembles knights from the Round Table group plus 28 others selected by Merlin, totaling the full number. The Archbishop blesses seats; each knight's name appears in gold on the back, except one: the Siege Perilous, fatal to sit in unless chosen by Heaven.\n\nYoung Gawain, Arthur's nephew, is knighted. A poor cowherd Aries petitions Arthur to knight his son Tor, who is passionate about knighthood despite his siblings' contentment in labor. Arthur knights Tor, noting his noble bearing. Merlin reveals Tor as the son of King Pellinore, a renowned knight. Pellinore arrives, honors Arthur, and is seated near the Perilous Seat.\n\nGawain, resenting Pellinore for killing his father Lot, plots murder with brother Gaheris but delays. Arthur addresses the knights, swearing them to truth, nobility, mercy, aid to ladies, and avoidance of treason, cruelty, or wrongful quarrels. He mandates annual Pentecost reports. The Round Table order is formalized, attracting world's best knights.\n\nThe wedding and coronation of Arthur and Guinevere are lavish: processions with kings bearing golden swords, queens with white doves, music, and joy. A high feast follows, with Arthur and Guinevere seated prominently."
